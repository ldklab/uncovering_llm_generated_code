Ten cars, which have numbers from 1 to 10 respectively, use the rail tracks.\nWe can simulate the movement (comings and goings) of the cars as follow:\nAn entry of a car is represented by its number.\nAn exit of a car is represented by 0\nFor example, a sequence\n1\n6\n0\n8\n10\ndemonstrates that car 1 and car 6 enter to the rail tracks in this order, car 6 exits from the rail tracks, and then car 8 and car 10 enter.\nWrite a program which simulates comings and goings of the cars which are represented by the sequence of car numbers. The program should read the sequence of car numbers and 0, and print numbers of cars which exit from the rail tracks in order. At the first, there are no cars on the rail tracks. You can assume that 0 will not be given when there is no car on the rail tracks.\nInput\ncar number\ncar number or 0\ncar number or 0\n  .\n  .\n  .\ncar number or 0\nThe number of input lines is less than or equal to 100.\nOutput\nFor each 0, print the car number.\nSample Input\n1\n6\n0\n8\n10\n0\n0\n0\nOutput for the Sample Input\n6\n10\n8\n1",

The provided Node.js code defines a module that exports a function to generate a file path with a unique slug appended to it. 

Here's how the code works:

1. The `path` module from Node.js is imported, allowing manipulation of file paths.
2. The `unique-slug` package is imported, which generates a unique slug based on an input.
3. The exported function takes three parameters: `filepath`, `prefix`, and `uniq`.
   - `filepath` is the base path to which the slug will be appended.
   - `prefix` is an optional string that will be prepended to the slug, followed by a hyphen, if provided.
   - `uniq` is the input from which the unique slug will be generated.
4. The function returns a new file path combining `filepath` and a slug. If `prefix` is provided, it is prepended to the slug.

Here is a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';
const path = require('path');
const uniqueSlug = require('unique-slug');

function generateFilePath(basePath, prefix, uniqInput) {
  const slug = uniqueSlug(uniqInput);
  const formattedPrefix = prefix ? `${prefix}-` : '';
  return path.join(basePath, `${formattedPrefix}${slug}`);
}

module.exports = generateFilePath;
```

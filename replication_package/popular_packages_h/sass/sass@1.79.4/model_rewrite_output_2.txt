The given Node.js code snippet is importing and executing a JavaScript file named `sass.dart.js`. Then, it retrieves the last element from an array `_cliPkgExports` attached to the global context (`globalThis`) and assigns it to `library`. If `_cliPkgExports` becomes empty as a result, it deletes this property from `globalThis`. The retrieved `library` has a `load` function that is called with several Node.js core modules (i.e., `util`, `stream`, `module`, `fs`) and a third-party module `immutable`. Finally, the script exports the `library` object for use in other parts of the application.

Here is a rewritten version of that code:

```javascript
require('./sass.dart.js');

const cliPackageExports = globalThis._cliPkgExports;
const library = cliPackageExports.pop();

if (cliPackageExports.length === 0) {
  delete globalThis._cliPkgExports;
}

const modules = {
  util: require("util"),
  stream: require("stream"),
  nodeModule: require("module"),
  fs: require("fs"),
  immutable: require("immutable"),
};

library.load(modules);

module.exports = library;
```

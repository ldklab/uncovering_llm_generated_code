The original Node.js code is responsible for loading and initializing a library from a Dart transpiled JavaScript code. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It requires a JavaScript file (likely transpiled from Dart), which presumably sets `globalThis._cliPkgExports` to some array of exports.
2. It retrieves the last library from this exports array using `pop()`.
3. If `_cliPkgExports` array is empty after removing the library, it deletes `_cliPkgExports` from the global context.
4. It calls a `load` method on the library passing an object as an argument. This object consists of common Node.js modules such as `util`, `stream`, `module`, `fs`, and a third-party library `immutable`.
5. Finally, it exports the library as a module for use in other parts of the application.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code according to the explained functionality:

```javascript
require('./sass.dart.js');

function initializeLibrary() {
  const libraryExports = globalThis._cliPkgExports;
  const library = libraryExports.pop(); 

  if (libraryExports.length === 0) {
    delete globalThis._cliPkgExports;
  }

  library.load({
    util: require("util"),
    stream: require("stream"),
    nodeModule: require("module"),
    fs: require("fs"),
    immutable: require("immutable"),
  });

  return library;
}

const library = initializeLibrary();
module.exports = library;
```

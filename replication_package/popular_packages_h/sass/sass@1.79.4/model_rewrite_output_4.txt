The given Node.js code is loading a Dart library compiled to JavaScript, stored in the file `sass.dart.js`, and interacting with it using an exports mechanism. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Import of Dart JS**: The code requires a JavaScript file `sass.dart.js` which is likely a Dart package transpiled to JavaScript. This can introduce some exported properties or functions into the global scope, specifically into `globalThis._cliPkgExports`.

2. **Access and Delete Exports**: It assumes that `globalThis._cliPkgExports` is an array where a Dart library's `exports` is temporarily stored. The last item is popped from the array and then assigned to a constant `library`. If the array becomes empty after this operation, the array is deleted from the global scope.

3. **Library Load**: The `library` object has a `load` function which is called with a configuration object. This object includes built-in Node.js modules (`util`, `stream`, `module`, `fs`) and one additional `immutable` module.

4. **Module Export**: Finally, it exports this library module for use in other parts of the application or for public use as a Node.js module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the above code:

```javascript
require('./sass.dart.js');

const importedLibrary = globalThis._cliPkgExports.pop();

if (globalThis._cliPkgExports.length === 0) {
  delete globalThis._cliPkgExports;
}

importedLibrary.load({
  util: require("util"),
  stream: require("stream"),
  nodeModule: require("module"),
  fs: require("fs"),
  immutable: require("immutable"),
});

module.exports = importedLibrary;
```

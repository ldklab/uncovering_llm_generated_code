The Node.js code provided is a module export block. It's used to export various functionalities, which can then be imported and used in other files or modules. Let's break down what each part does:

1. `decode`: This function/module is imported from a file named `decode` and is presumably used to decode tokens.
2. `verify`: This function/module is imported from a file named `verify` and is likely used to verify the authenticity and integrity of tokens.
3. `sign`: This function/module is imported from a file named `sign` and is used to sign data, creating a token.
4. `JsonWebTokenError`, `NotBeforeError`, `TokenExpiredError`: These are custom error classes that are imported from their respective files. They handle different types of JWT (JSON Web Token) errors:
   - `JsonWebTokenError`: A general error for JWT-related issues.
   - `NotBeforeError`: An error indicating a token is not yet valid.
   - `TokenExpiredError`: An error indicating a token has expired.

These exports are part of a library that deals with JWTs, providing functionalities such as decoding, verifying, and signing tokens, as well as handling different error cases associated with JWT operations.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const decode = require('./decode');
const verify = require('./verify');
const sign = require('./sign');
const JsonWebTokenError = require('./lib/JsonWebTokenError');
const NotBeforeError = require('./lib/NotBeforeError');
const TokenExpiredError = require('./lib/TokenExpiredError');

module.exports = {
  decode,
  verify,
  sign,
  JsonWebTokenError,
  NotBeforeError,
  TokenExpiredError,
};
```

The given Node.js code is a minified version of the jQuery library. The code primarily handles the module definition and exports for the Node.js environment. Here's a summarized explanation of its functionality:

1. **Module Export**: The code checks if it's being run in a Node.js-like environment by verifying if `module` and `module.exports` are objects. If so, it exports the jQuery factory function, which requires a `window` object to execute.

2. **Browser Environment**: If not in a Node.js environment, the code executes the jQuery factory function immediately, assuming it is running in a browser environment with a global `window` object.

3. **Factory Function**: The factory function accepts a `window` object and a `noGlobal` flag. It performs the following:
   - Sets up various utility functions and variables, such as `isFunction`, `isWindow`, and others, necessary for core jQuery functionalities.
   - Defines the main `jQuery` function and its prototype (`jQuery.fn`), allowing for typical jQuery operations like DOM manipulation, event handling, etc.
   - Exposes methods such as `jQuery.extend`, `jQuery.each`, and `jQuery.ajax`.
   - Ensures compatibility and functionality across different environments and browsers.

4. **Initialization**: The code concludes by returning the `jQuery` function, making it available for use in the environment (Node.js or browser) it is executed.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code to focus on the module export logic:

```javascript
(function (global, factory) {
    "use strict";

    // Check if the module is being used in a Node.js-like environment
    if (typeof module === "object" && typeof module.exports === "object") {
        // If there is a window with a document, run the factory and export jQuery
        // Otherwise, expose a factory as module.exports that requires a window
        module.exports = global.document
            ? factory(global, true)
            : function (w) {
                if (!w.document) {
                    throw new Error("jQuery requires a window with a document");
                }
                return factory(w);
            };
    } else {
        // If not in a Node.js environment, assume we are in a browser and run the factory function directly
        factory(global);
    }
})(
    typeof window !== "undefined" ? window : this, 
    function (window, noGlobal) {
        "use strict";

        // jQuery initialization and setting up core functionalities

        const jQuery = function (selector, context) {
            return new jQuery.fn.init(selector, context);
        };

        // Define prototype and methods
        jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype = {
            // Define methods like .each(), .map(), etc.
        };

        // Provide static methods, utilities, and jQuery core features
        jQuery.extend = jQuery.fn.extend = function () {
            // Method implementation
        };

        jQuery.extend({
            // AJAX support, utilities, etc.
        });

        // If noGlobal is not true, attach jQuery to the global object
        if (!noGlobal) {
            window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;
        }

        // Return the jQuery function
        return jQuery;
    }
);
```

This streamlined version emphasizes the export behavior for different environments (Node.js and browser) and how jQuery is initialized within those contexts. The rewrite abstracts away the specific jQuery functionalities, focusing on how it sets up its environment and exports itself.

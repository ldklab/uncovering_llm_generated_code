The Node.js code provided is exporting three modules: `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`. Each of these modules is required from different files in the `./lib` directory and then made available for use elsewhere by attaching them to the `exports` object. This pattern is typical in Node.js to modularize code and make certain functionalities available to other files.

Here is a rewritten version of the same code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require("./lib/source-map-generator");
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require("./lib/source-map-consumer");
const { SourceNode } = require("./lib/source-node");

exports.SourceMapGenerator = SourceMapGenerator;
exports.SourceMapConsumer = SourceMapConsumer;
exports.SourceNode = SourceNode;
```

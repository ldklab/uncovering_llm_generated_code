The provided Node.js code is part of a module that exports three constructors or classes related to source maps. These exports are `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`, and they are imported from separate files located within a `lib` directory. Each of these constructors or classes likely provides different functionalities for creating, consuming, and managing source maps, which are used to map minified or transpiled code back to the original source.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
// Import and export the SourceMapGenerator, SourceMapConsumer, and SourceNode 
// classes from their respective modules located in the 'lib' directory. 
// These classes are part of the source map support functionality.

const { SourceMapGenerator } = require("./lib/source-map-generator");
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require("./lib/source-map-consumer");
const { SourceNode } = require("./lib/source-node");

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};
```

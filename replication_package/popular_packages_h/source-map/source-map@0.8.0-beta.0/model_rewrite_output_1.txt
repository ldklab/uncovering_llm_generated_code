The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export three modules: `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`. These modules are required from separate files located in a `lib` directory. The code is likely a part of a library that deals with source maps, which are used to map a combined/minified file back to an unbuilt state for debugging purposes.

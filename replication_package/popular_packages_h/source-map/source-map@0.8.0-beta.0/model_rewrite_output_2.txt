The Node.js code exports three constructors or classes from different modules within a library related to source maps: `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`. Each of these is required from their respective files in a `lib` directory. The purpose of these exports is to make these classes available for use in other files that import this module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require("./lib/source-map-generator");
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require("./lib/source-map-consumer");
const { SourceNode } = require("./lib/source-node");

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};
```

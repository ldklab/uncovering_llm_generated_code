The given Node.js code is essentially importing and then exporting three components from different modules located in the `./lib/` directory. These components likely belong to a library used for handling source maps, as indicated by their names:

1. `SourceMapGenerator`: This module might be responsible for generating source maps, which are files that map code back to the original source positions.
2. `SourceMapConsumer`: This module might be used for reading (consuming) and interpreting source maps.
3. `SourceNode`: Possibly a utility or object related to source maps that may deal with representing a chunk of code along with its source map information.

These modules are being required from their respective files in the `lib` directory and are then made available for export under the `exports` object. This allows other files or modules to access these components when this file is required.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// Load and export modules related to handling source maps from the ./lib directory
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require("./lib/source-map-generator");
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require("./lib/source-map-consumer");
const { SourceNode } = require("./lib/source-node");

// Export the loaded modules for external use
exports.SourceMapGenerator = SourceMapGenerator;
exports.SourceMapConsumer = SourceMapConsumer;
exports.SourceNode = SourceNode;
```

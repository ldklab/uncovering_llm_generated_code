The Node.js code provided is exporting functionalities from different modules related to source maps. Source maps are files that map code within a compressed file to the original source file. The code is requiring these modules from the `./lib/` directory:

- `SourceMapGenerator`: Likely provides functionality to generate source maps.
- `SourceMapConsumer`: Likely provides functionality to read or consume source maps.
- `SourceNode`: Likely represents a node in the source map, potentially allowing manipulation of source code positions.

These functions or classes are then exported so they can be used in other parts of the application or by other applications that import this module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code according to the explained functionality:

```javascript
// Source map functionality modules
const SourceMapGenerator = require("./lib/source-map-generator").SourceMapGenerator;
const SourceMapConsumer = require("./lib/source-map-consumer").SourceMapConsumer;
const SourceNode = require("./lib/source-node").SourceNode;

// Exporting functionalities for external usage
module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};
```

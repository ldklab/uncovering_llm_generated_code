The provided Node.js code is part of a module that exports three main classes: `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`. These classes are likely involved with handling source maps, which are used to map transformed code back to the original source code (for example, mapping transpiled JavaScript code back to its original TypeScript or ES6+ source). Each of these classes are required from their respective files within a library directory `./lib`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript

const SourceMapGenerator = require("./lib/source-map-generator").SourceMapGenerator;
const SourceMapConsumer = require("./lib/source-map-consumer").SourceMapConsumer;
const SourceNode = require("./lib/source-node").SourceNode;

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};

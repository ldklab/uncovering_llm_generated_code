The given Node.js code is exporting three modules related to source maps from separate files within the 'lib' directory. Each of these modules likely provides different functionalities concerning source map generation and consumption.

- `SourceMapGenerator`: This module is expected to be responsible for generating source maps, which are used to map code within a compressed file back to its location in the original source files, aiding in debugging.
  
- `SourceMapConsumer`: This module likely provides functionalities for consuming or interpreting source maps, which might assist in understanding and utilizing them within applications or development tools.

- `SourceNode`: This module probably involves operations related to the creation and manipulation of a "source node", which is possibly a data structure or tool helpful in the generation or manipulation of source maps.

Now, here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require("./lib/source-map-generator");
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require("./lib/source-map-consumer");
const { SourceNode } = require("./lib/source-node");

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode,
};
```

The provided Node.js code snippet is a simple module export statement. It imports a module located at `./lib`, which is considered a relative path to the current file's location, and then immediately exports it. This allows other files to import and use the functionality defined in the `./lib` module through this file.

A possible rewrite could include additional logging for debugging purposes, handling for errors, or environment-specific configurations. Here is a similar rewrite with added logging:

```javascript
'use strict';

try {
    const libModule = require('./lib');
    console.log('Successfully loaded ./lib module');
    module.exports = libModule;
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load ./lib module', error);
    throw error; // rethrow the error after logging it
}
```

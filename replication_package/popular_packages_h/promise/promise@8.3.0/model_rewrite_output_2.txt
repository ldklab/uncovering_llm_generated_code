The functionality of this Node.js code is to export the contents of another module for use elsewhere in an application. The code is using CommonJS syntax to require a module located in a directory named `lib` relative to the file's location. Once the module is required, it is then exported using `module.exports`. This allows other files in the application to import this module and access whatever functionality, objects, or classes the `lib` module exposes.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const libModule = require('./lib');
module.exports = libModule;
```

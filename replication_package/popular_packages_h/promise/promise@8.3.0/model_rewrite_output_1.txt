The Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports whatever is returned from requiring the module located at the relative path `'./lib'`. This means that when a user imports this module, they will actually receive the exports from the `lib` module. This is often used in Node.js projects where the main functionality or a suite of them is placed in a separate file or directory, and the main entry point of the module just re-exports that functionality.

Below is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Re-export the functionality from the './lib' module
const lib = require('./lib');

module.exports = lib;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple statement that exports the contents of another module located at `'./lib'`. Here's how it functions:

1. `'use strict';`: This line enables strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding mistakes and “unsafe” actions such as defining global variables unintentionally.

2. `module.exports = require('./lib');`: This statement exports whatever is being exported by the module located at `'./lib'`. The `require()` function is used to import the specified module, and then `module.exports` assigns the contents of `'./lib'` for use in other parts of the application.

The rewritten code with the same functionality is:

```javascript
'use strict';

const libModule = require('./lib');

module.exports = libModule;
```

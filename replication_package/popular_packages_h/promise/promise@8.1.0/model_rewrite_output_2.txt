The given Node.js code exports a module located in the './lib' directory. This means that when this module is required in another file, it imports whatever is exported from the './lib' directory. Effectively, it acts as a re-exporting file that forwards the contents of the './lib' directory to other parts of the application that import it.

Here's a rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const libModule = require('./lib');

module.exports = libModule;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module export. It imports a module from a file located at './lib' and then exports it. This allows whatever is exported from './lib' to be accessible when this module is imported elsewhere in a Node.js application. The 'use strict'; directive at the top of the file is used to enforce strict mode, which is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript that helps in catching common coding bugs, preventing the use of some error-prone JavaScript features, and enhancing performance.

Here's a possible rewrite for the above Node.js code:
```javascript
"use strict";

const libraryModule = require('./lib');

module.exports = libraryModule;
```
This version stores the imported module in a constant `libraryModule` before exporting it. This makes the code slightly more readable and allows for easier modifications or additions in future if needed.

The given Node.js code is a very simple module that exports whatever is contained in another module located in the `lib` directory. When this module is imported using `require`, the contents of the module from the `lib` directory will be available for use. This is a common pattern for organizing code by placing the main logic in a separate file (or set of files) within a subdirectory like `lib` and then exporting it through a main entry file.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the contents of the 'lib' directory module.
const libModule = require('./lib');

// Export the imported modules or functionalities from './lib'
module.exports = libModule;
```

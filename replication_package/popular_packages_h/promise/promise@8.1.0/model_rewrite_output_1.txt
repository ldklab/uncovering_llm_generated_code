The Node.js code acts as a module that exports the contents of another module located in the `'./lib'` directory. By using `module.exports`, it makes whatever is being exported from `'./lib'` available to other files that require this module. The `'use strict';` directive ensures that the code is executed in strict mode, which helps catch common coding mistakes and potentially unsafe actions.

Here's a possible rewrite that achieves the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const libModule = require('./lib');

module.exports = libModule;
```

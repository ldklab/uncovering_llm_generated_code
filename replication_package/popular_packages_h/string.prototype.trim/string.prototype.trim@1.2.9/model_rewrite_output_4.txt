The provided Node.js code is a module that aims to provide a "trim" functionality for strings. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It uses `require` to import multiple functionalities from other modules such as `call-bind`, `define-properties`, `RequireObjectCoercible`, as well as local modules `implementation`, `getPolyfill`, and `shim`.

2. `callBind` is used with `getPolyfill()` to create a bound function `bound`. This function is probably a version of the `trim` method.

3. The `boundMethod` is a new function that first checks whether the `receiver` (the string on which the trim operation will be performed) is coercible, meaning it can be converted to an object. This is done using `RequireObjectCoercible`.

4. Once the receiver has been verified as a coercible value, the `bound` function is called on it, which will effectively perform the trim operation using the polyfill.

5. `define` is used to attach additional properties to the `boundMethod`: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`. These properties provide access to the polyfill setup, the base implementation, and the shim application method respectively. 

6. Finally, the `boundMethod` function is exported as a module, allowing other parts of the application to use the trimmed string functionality.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const define = require('define-properties');
const RequireObjectCoercible = require('es-object-atoms/RequireObjectCoercible');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundFunction = callBind(getPolyfill());

const trimMethod = function trim(receiver) {
    RequireObjectCoercible(receiver);
    return boundFunction(receiver);
};

define(trimMethod, {
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    implementation: implementation,
    shim: shim
});

module.exports = trimMethod;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module related to the Cheerio library, which is typically used for server-side DOM manipulation, similar to jQuery. The main functionality of this code is to export static methods from the `staticMethods` module (presumably from another part of the Cheerio library) and add some library versioning information. Here's an explanation of the code's components:

1. **Static Methods Importation**: It imports functions from `./lib/static` and assigns them to a `staticMethods` variable, which is then used to attach these methods as properties to the `exports` object.

2. **Version Information**: It exports a `version` property, which is read from the `package.json` file, indicating the version of the Cheerio library being used.

3. **Method Exports**: The code exports the following static methods:
   - `load`: Loads HTML content into a Cheerio object.
   - `html`: Serializes a Cheerio object back into HTML.
   - `text`: Extracts text content from a Cheerio object.
   - `xml`: Serializes a Cheerio object into XML.

4. **Deprecated Methods**: It provides deprecated methods `contains`, `merge`, `parseHTML`, and `root`, encouraging the use of their corresponding static methods for consistency with jQuery.

The code has a module-level documentation block indicating the re-exported methods and several function-level comments providing usage examples and deprecation warnings.

Hereâ€™s a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// Import the required static methods for DOM manipulation
const staticMethods = require('./lib/static');

// Main export for supporting Cheerio functionality
const cheerio = module.exports = require('./lib/cheerio');

// Export Cheerio library version info from package.json
cheerio.version = require('./package.json').version;

// Attach static methods to the main export for consistency with the jQuery library
cheerio.load = staticMethods.load;
cheerio.html = staticMethods.html;
cheerio.text = staticMethods.text;
cheerio.xml = staticMethods.xml;

// Deprecated methods for backward compatibility, encouraging users to use static methods instead
/**
 * Determine if an element is a descendant of another
 * @deprecated
 */
cheerio.contains = staticMethods.contains;

/**
 * Merge two arrays, similar to jQuery's merge method
 * @deprecated
 */
cheerio.merge = staticMethods.merge;

/**
 * Parse a string into an array of DOM nodes
 * @deprecated See {@link static/parseHTML}
 */
cheerio.parseHTML = staticMethods.parseHTML;

/**
 * Get the root element of a parsed document
 * @deprecated
 */
cheerio.root = staticMethods.root;

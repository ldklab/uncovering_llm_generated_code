The given Node.js code is a module definition for the Cheerio library. It imports static methods from a local file and re-exports them to provide convenient functions for HTML/XML parsing and manipulation, similar to jQuery. The module provides methods like `load`, `html`, `text`, and `xml`, which correspond to the functionalities of Cheerio for loading and processing markup.

Additionally, the code includes some deprecated methods (`contains`, `merge`, `parseHTML`, and `root`) for backward compatibility and encourages using the newer static versions of these methods instead, to maintain consistency with the jQuery library. It also exports the version number of the Cheerio library by reading it from the `package.json` file.

Here's a rewritten version of this Node.js code:

```javascript
var cheerioStaticMethods = require('./lib/static');
var cheerio = require('./lib/cheerio');

cheerio.version = require('./package.json').version;

cheerio.load = cheerioStaticMethods.load;
cheerio.html = cheerioStaticMethods.html;
cheerio.text = cheerioStaticMethods.text;
cheerio.xml = cheerioStaticMethods.xml;

// Deprecated methods
cheerio.contains = cheerioStaticMethods.contains;
cheerio.merge = cheerioStaticMethods.merge;
cheerio.parseHTML = cheerioStaticMethods.parseHTML;
cheerio.root = cheerioStaticMethods.root;

module.exports = cheerio;
```

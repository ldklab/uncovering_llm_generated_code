The provided Node.js code is a module that exports the `AbortError` class or object from another module located in the file `./AbortError.js`. This is done by requiring the `AbortError_js_1` from the specified file and then using `Object.defineProperty` to set the export of `AbortError` such that it can be accessed when this module is imported elsewhere. The use of `"use strict";` at the beginning ensures that the code runs in strict mode, which helps in catching common coding bugs and enforces stricter parsing of JavaScript.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license.

const { AbortError } = require("./AbortError.js");

exports.AbortError = AbortError;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

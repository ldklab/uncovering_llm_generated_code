The given Node.js code is exporting a built-in JavaScript object, `Error`, from a module. By doing so, the module makes the `Error` object available to any other module that requires this one. The `Error` object is used for creating error instances that can be thrown in the program, and it's a fundamental part of error handling in JavaScript. 

Here's a possible rewritten version of the code that achieves the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the built-in JavaScript Error object
module.exports = global.Error;
```

This version explicitly refers to `global.Error` to highlight that the exported `Error` is the globally available constructor function for error. This maintains the functionality of the original module export.

The Node.js code provided is a module that exports the built-in JavaScript `Error` object. The line `'use strict';` enables strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and prevents the use of potentially problematic JavaScript features. The `/** @type {import('.')} */` is a JSDoc comment, likely indicating where the type is being imported from, although it does not seem to have a direct impact on the functioning of this code as it currently stands.

The purpose of this module is to allow the `Error` object to be easily imported and used in other parts of a Node.js application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the built-in JavaScript Error object for use in other modules
module.exports = Error;
```

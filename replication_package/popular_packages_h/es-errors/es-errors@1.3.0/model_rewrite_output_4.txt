The functionality of the given Node.js code is quite simple. It is exporting the built-in JavaScript `Error` class as a module. This allows other files to import this module and use the `Error` class directly.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the built-in Error class
module.exports = Error;
```

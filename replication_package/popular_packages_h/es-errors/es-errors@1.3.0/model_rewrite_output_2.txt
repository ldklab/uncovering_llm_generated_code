The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export the global `Error` object as a module. This allows you to import this exported `Error` object in other parts of your application or in other modules. The `Error` object in JavaScript is used to create error instances, which contain information about the error, such as the error message, line number, etc. By exporting `Error`, it would be possible to either use it directly or extend it to create custom error types in other modules.

### Rewritten Code

```javascript
'use strict';

/** 
 * Export the global `Error` object for use in other modules. 
 * 
 * By exporting this, other modules can utilize the native Error functionality 
 * or extend it to create custom error objects.
 */
module.exports = Error;
```

The Node.js code is performing a simple environment check to determine which version of the React library (`react-is`) to export. It checks the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to ascertain whether the application is running in a 'production' or 'development' environment. If it's in 'production', it exports the minified production version of the library from `./cjs/react-is.production.min.js`. Otherwise, it exports the development version from `./cjs/react-is.development.js`. This decision structure ensures that the application uses the optimized, smaller build for production environments and the more informative, larger build for development, which typically includes helpful warnings and error messages.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const reactIsPath = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js'
  : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(reactIsPath);
```

The Node.js code is a conditional module export that chooses the appropriate file to export based on the environment variable `NODE_ENV`. The code checks if the `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`. If it is, it exports the contents of the file `react-is.production.min.js` from the `'./cjs/'` directory. Otherwise, meaning if the `NODE_ENV` is not `'production'` (usually it implies a development environment), it exports the contents of the file `react-is.development.js` from the same directory. This functionality allows for different versions of a module to be used depending on whether the execution environment is for production or development, which is a common practice to optimize performance and debugging capability.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const fileName = isProduction ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(fileName);
```

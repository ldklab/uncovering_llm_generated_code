The given Node.js code is a module export script that conditionally exports different versions of a library based on the environment. The `process.env.NODE_ENV` is used to determine if the environment is 'production' or not. If it's 'production', it exports the minified production version of the library located at `'./cjs/react-is.production.min.js'`. Otherwise, it exports the development version located at `'./cjs/react-is.development.js'`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const file = isProduction ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(file);
```

The Node.js code is a module that conditionally exports different files based on the environment in which the code is being executed. Specifically, it checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine if the environment is 'production'. 

- If the `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports a minified production version of the `react-is` library from `./cjs/react-is.production.min.js`.
- Otherwise, it exports a development version of the `react-is` library from `./cjs/react-is.development.js`.

This is typically used to ensure that the production build is optimized and minified, while the development build contains more detailed information and possible debugging capabilities.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const filePath = isProduction ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(filePath);
```

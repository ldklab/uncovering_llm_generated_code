The provided Node.js code is a configuration script used to dynamically import and export different versions of a module based on the environment in which the application is running. The `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable is employed to determine the environment. If the environment is set to 'production', the script exports the minified production version of the module `react-is`. Otherwise, it defaults to exporting the development version of the module, which is typically unminified and includes more robust error messages and warnings to aid in development.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction 
  ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' 
  : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

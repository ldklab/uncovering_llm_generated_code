The provided Node.js code determines which version of a module to export based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. It checks if the environment is set to 'production'; if true, it exports the production-optimized minified version of the `react-is` library. Otherwise, it exports the development version, which is presumably unminified and includes additional debugging capabilities.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const path = isProduction ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(path);
```

The given Node.js code is designed to export different JavaScript files depending on the current environment, which is determined by the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This is a common pattern used to optimize applications by loading a lighter, optimized version of a library for production and a more verbose, developer-friendly version for development.

- When `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, the code exports the minified production version of the `react-is` library.
- For any other environment (such as `'development'`), it exports the development version of the `react-is` library.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = environment === 'production';
const filePath = isProduction 
  ? './cjs/react-is.production.min.js' 
  : './cjs/react-is.development.js';

module.exports = require(filePath);
```

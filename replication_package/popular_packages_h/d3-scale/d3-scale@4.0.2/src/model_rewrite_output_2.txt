```javascript
// This Node.js code is a collection of export statements that regroup and rename
// exports from different module files. Each export statement imports a specific default
// or named export from a module file and re-exports them with a new naming convention.
// This is typically used to create a cohesive public API by consolidating related modules
// under a unified namespace.

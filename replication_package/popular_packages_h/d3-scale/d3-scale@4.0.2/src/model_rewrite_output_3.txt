The Node.js code is a set of export statements for various scaling functions typically used in visualization libraries, like D3.js. Each scaling function has a default export from its corresponding module file which is imported and then immediately exported under a specific alias. Some exports also include additional named exports with their own aliases. The scaling types include band, identity, linear, logarithmic, symlog, ordinal, power, radial, quantile, quantize, threshold, time, sequential, diverging, etc. Additionally, a utility function called `tickFormat` is exported.

Below is a rewrite of the given Node.js code organized neatly in a single markdown block:

```javascript
export {
  default as scaleBand,
  point as scalePoint
} from "./band.js";

export {
  default as scaleIdentity
} from "./identity.js";

export {
  default as scaleLinear
} from "./linear.js";

export {
  default as scaleLog
} from "./log.js";

export {
  default as scaleSymlog
} from "./symlog.js";

export {
  default as scaleOrdinal,
  implicit as scaleImplicit
} from "./ordinal.js";

export {
  default as scalePow,
  sqrt as scaleSqrt
} from "./pow.js";

export {
  default as scaleRadial
} from "./radial.js";

export {
  default as scaleQuantile
} from "./quantile.js";

export {
  default as scaleQuantize
} from "./quantize.js";

export {
  default as scaleThreshold
} from "./threshold.js";

export {
  default as scaleTime
} from "./time.js";

export {

} from "./utcTime.js";

export {
  default as scaleSequential,
  sequentialLog as scaleSequentialLog,
  sequentialPow as scaleSequentialPow,
  sequentialSqrt as scaleSequentialSqrt,
  sequentialSymlog as scaleSequentialSymlog
} from "./sequential.js";

export {
  default as scaleSequentialQuantile
} from "./sequentialQuantile.js";

export {
  default as scaleDiverging,
  divergingLog as scaleDivergingLog,
  divergingPow as scaleDivergingPow,

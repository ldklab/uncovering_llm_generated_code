The Node.js code is exporting various scale and formatting functions from different files. These functions are often used in data visualization libraries. Each `export` statement imports the default export from a module (e.g., `scaleBand` from `./band.js`) and assigns an alias to it. In some cases, additional named exports from the modules are also alias-imported (e.g., `point` as `scalePoint` from `./band.js`).

The rewritten code below maintains the same functionality, using `export` statements to aggregate various scale-related functions and utilities:

```javascript
export {
  default as scaleBand,
  point as scalePoint
} from "./band.js";

export { default as scaleIdentity } from "./identity.js";
export { default as scaleLinear } from "./linear.js";
export { default as scaleLog } from "./log.js";
export { default as scaleSymlog } from "./symlog.js";

export {
  default as scaleOrdinal,
  implicit as scaleImplicit
} from "./ordinal.js";

export {
  default as scalePow,
  sqrt as scaleSqrt
} from "./pow.js";

export { default as scaleRadial } from "./radial.js";
export { default as scaleQuantile } from "./quantile.js";
export { default as scaleQuantize } from "./quantize.js";
export { default as scaleThreshold } from "./threshold.js";
export { default as scaleTime } from "./time.js";
export { default as scaleUtc } from "./utcTime.js";

export {
  default as scaleSequential,
  sequentialLog as scaleSequentialLog,
  sequentialPow as scaleSequentialPow,
  sequentialSqrt as scaleSequentialSqrt,
  sequentialSymlog as scaleSequentialSymlog
} from "./sequential.js";

export { default as scaleSequentialQuantile } from "./sequentialQuantile.js";

export {
  default as scaleDiverging,
  divergingLog as scaleDivergingLog,
  divergingPow as scaleDivergingPow,
  divergingSqrt as scaleDivergingSqrt,
  divergingSymlog as scaleDivergingSymlog
} from "./diverging.js";

export { default as tickFormat } from "./tickFormat.js";
```

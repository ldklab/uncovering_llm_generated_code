The given Node.js code is part of a package module typically used in a JavaScript environment, specifically for React Router v6.26.2. The code is designed to export different versions of the React Router library based on the environment in which the node process is running. 

In summary:
- If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `"production"`, the code will export a minified production version of the library.
- If the `NODE_ENV` is set to any other value (commonly `"development"`), it will export a non-minified development version of the library.

Here's a rewritten version of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = environment === "production";

const productionFile = "./umd/react-router.production.min.js";
const developmentFile = "./umd/react-router.development.js";

module.exports = require(isProduction ? productionFile : developmentFile);
```

The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export a module depending on the current environment in which the Node.js application is running. Specifically, it checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is in 'production' mode or not. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it requires and exports the production-ready minified version of the 'react-router' module located in `./umd/react-router.production.min.js`. Otherwise, it requires and exports the development version located in `./umd/react-router.development.js`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const reactRouterPath = isProduction 
  ? './umd/react-router.production.min.js' 
  : './umd/react-router.development.js';

module.exports = require(reactRouterPath);
```

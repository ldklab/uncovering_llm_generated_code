The Node.js code is a module that exports a specific version of the `react-router` library based on the current environment. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a production or development environment. If the `NODE_ENV` is set to "production", it requires and exports the minified production version of `react-router` (`react-router.production.min.js`). Otherwise, it requires and exports the development version (`react-router.development.js`).

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = environment === 'production';
const routerPath = isProduction ? './umd/react-router.production.min.js' : './umd/react-router.development.js';

module.exports = require(routerPath);
```

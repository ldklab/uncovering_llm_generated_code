The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports the contents of a directory or module located at `'./lib/'`. When another file imports this module, it will gain access to everything that is exported from the module or files within the `'./lib/'` directory. The code uses the CommonJS module system for exporting.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the module or contents from the './lib/' directory
module.exports = require('./lib/');
```

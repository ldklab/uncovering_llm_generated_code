The Node.js code provided is a simple module export statement, often found in JavaScript files like `index.js` in a Node.js package. This code is exporting whatever is provided in the `./lib/` directory. Typically, this means that the entry point of the module resides in the `lib` directory, where it aggregates and structures the code to make it usable as a module in other parts of an application or by external applications when published as a package.

The following is a concise rewrite of the above code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const libModule = require('./lib/');

module.exports = libModule;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement that exports whatever is being exported from the `./lib/` directory. This means that when this module is imported elsewhere in a Node.js application, it will provide the same exports as the ones defined in the `./lib/` directory. This is commonly used to re-export functionality, potentially aggregating multiple modules or providing a clean interface.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const lib = require('./lib/');
module.exports = lib;
```

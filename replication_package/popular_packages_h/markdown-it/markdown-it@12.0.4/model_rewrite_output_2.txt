The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports whatever is being exported by a module located in the `./lib/` directory. This kind of pattern is common in Node.js projects where the main module file (`index.js` or equivalent) simply re-exports content from another directory, often because the main business logic or main set of functionalities are organized within that subdirectory. The use of `'use strict';` ensures that the code is executed in strict mode, which can prevent certain types of errors and promotes best practices.

Here's a potential rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export the module located in the lib directory, allowing consumers
// to access the functionalities provided by the lib module
const libModule = require('./lib/');
module.exports = libModule;
```

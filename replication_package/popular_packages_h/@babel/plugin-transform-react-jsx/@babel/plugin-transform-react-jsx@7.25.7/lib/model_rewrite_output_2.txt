The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a single default object or function. It imports a function from another module named `create-plugin.js` and then uses this imported function to create a new object or function with specific properties (`name` and `development`) which it assigns to the default export. The object has a name property set to `"transform-react-jsx"` and a development property set to `false`. This suggests that the plugin it creates is likely used for transforming React JSX syntax during a build process, with certain behaviors tailored for a production environment (since `development: false`).

Here's a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the function to create a plugin from the specified module
const createPlugin = require("./create-plugin.js").default;

// Use the imported function to create a new plugin instance with specific properties
const transformReactJSX = createPlugin({
  name: "transform-react-jsx",
  development: false
});

// Export the created plugin as the default export of the module
module.exports = transformReactJSX;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

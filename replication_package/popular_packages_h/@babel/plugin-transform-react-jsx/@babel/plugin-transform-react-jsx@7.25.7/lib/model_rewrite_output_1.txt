The original Node.js code is a module that imports a function from a file called `create-plugin.js` and then exports a default object created using that imported function. This object is a plugin configuration with a specified name "transform-react-jsx" and a development flag set to `false`. This code is making use of ECMAScript modules syntax and strict mode to enforce secure coding practices. Additionally, a source map comment at the end suggests there might be an associated source map file for debugging purposes.

Here is the possible rewrite for this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import createPlugin from "./create-plugin.js";

const pluginConfig = createPlugin({
  name: "transform-react-jsx",
  development: false
});

export default pluginConfig;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

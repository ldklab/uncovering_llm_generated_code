The Node.js code provided is a module that exports a default plugin created using a function from the `create-plugin.js` file. This plugin is likely used to transform or handle JSX syntax in a development setting. The plugin has a name attribute "transform-react-jsx" and a flag indicating it's not intended for development use (`development: false`).

Hereâ€™s a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import createPlugin from './create-plugin.js';

const transformReactJsxPlugin = createPlugin({
  name: "transform-react-jsx",
  development: false
});

export default transformReactJsxPlugin;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

The given Node.js code is a Babel plugin that enables the `dynamicImport` syntax feature in the Babel parser. Babel is a JavaScript compiler, and plugins like this one modify how Babel transforms code. This particular plugin ensures that when Babel parses JavaScript code, it understands the `import()` function, which allows for dynamic importsâ€”loading modules asynchronously at runtime.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The code imports a utility function called `declare` from `@babel/helper-plugin-utils`.
2. A Babel plugin is created using this `declare` function. This function takes an API object as a parameter, through which you can enforce the Babel version by calling `api.assertVersion(7)`.
3. The plugin is configured with the name "syntax-dynamic-import".
4. The `manipulateOptions` method is defined, which is called during the setup phase of Babel's parser. This method pushes the "dynamicImport" plugin into the Babel parser's options, enabling the syntax for dynamic import statements in JavaScript code.
5. Finally, the plugin is exported as the default export.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { declare } = require("@babel/helper-plugin-utils");

module.exports = declare(api => {
  api.assertVersion(7);
  
  return {
    name: "syntax-dynamic-import",

    manipulateOptions(opts, parserOpts) {
      parserOpts.plugins.push("dynamicImport");
    }
  };
});
```

The provided Node.js code is exporting several functions from two modules: `identifier` and `keyword`. The exports are done using `Object.defineProperty`, which allows for very controlled property definitions on objects, here used to expose specific functions as named exports.

The code exports the following functions from the module 'identifier':
- `isIdentifierName` 
- `isIdentifierChar`
- `isIdentifierStart`

And the following functions from the module 'keyword':
- `isReservedWord`
- `isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord`
- `isStrictBindReservedWord`
- `isStrictReservedWord`
- `isKeyword`

Each export is configured to be enumerable and provides the getter function to return the corresponding function from the required module. This approach ensures that the exported function names are tied directly to their definitions in the required modules.

Here's a possible rewrite using ES6 module syntax:

```javascript
"use strict";

import {
  isIdentifierName,
  isIdentifierChar,
  isIdentifierStart
} from './identifier';

import {
  isReservedWord,
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord,
  isStrictBindReservedWord,
  isStrictReservedWord,
  isKeyword
} from './keyword';

export {
  isIdentifierName,
  isIdentifierChar,
  isIdentifierStart,
  isReservedWord,
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord,
  isStrictBindReservedWord,
  isStrictReservedWord,
  isKeyword
};
```

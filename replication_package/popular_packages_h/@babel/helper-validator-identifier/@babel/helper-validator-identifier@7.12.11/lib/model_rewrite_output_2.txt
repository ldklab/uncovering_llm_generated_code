The Node.js code is a module setup using ES6 module syntax with CommonJS compatibility. It defines a module that exports several functions related to identifiers and keywords. Specifically:

1. It imports functions from two separate modules: `./identifier` and `./keyword`.
2. It then re-exports these functions, making them available to other modules that import this module.
3. The functions exported concern checking if strings are valid identifier names, valid identifier characters, valid identifier start characters, reserved words, or keywords. The module provides functions to check for reserved words and keywords in both strict and non-strict modes.

Here is a rewrite of the provided code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Export functions to handle identifier operations
export { isIdentifierName, isIdentifierChar, isIdentifierStart } from "./identifier";

// Export functions to handle keyword operations
export { 
  isReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindReservedWord, 
  isStrictReservedWord, 
  isKeyword 
} from "./keyword";
```
This rewritten code uses ES6 import/export syntax directly. The `export` statements combine import and export operations in a more concise manner.

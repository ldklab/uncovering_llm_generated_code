The provided Node.js code is an example of module exports using `Object.defineProperty` to define exported properties on the `exports` object. This allows other modules to import and use these functions. The code is structured to import specific functions or methods from two modules (`./identifier` and `./keyword`). These functions are then exposed as part of this module's public API by adding them to the `exports` object in a way that makes them enumerable and sets up getters to return the imported functions. The functions being exported seem to be related to handling or validating JavaScript identifiers and keywords, as suggested by their names.

Here is the refactored code, using ES6 syntax to achieve the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

import { 
  isIdentifierName,
  isIdentifierChar,
  isIdentifierStart
} from "./identifier";

import { 
  isReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindReservedWord, 
  isStrictReservedWord, 
  isKeyword 
} from "./keyword";

export {
  isIdentifierName,
  isIdentifierChar,
  isIdentifierStart,
  isReservedWord,
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord,
  isStrictBindReservedWord,
  isStrictReservedWord,
  isKeyword
};
```

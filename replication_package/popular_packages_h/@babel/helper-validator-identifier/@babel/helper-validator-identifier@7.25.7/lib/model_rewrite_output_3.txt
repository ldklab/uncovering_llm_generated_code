The original Node.js code is exporting certain functions from the `identifier` and `keyword` modules so that they can be used by other modules that import them. It employs `Object.defineProperty` to set up named exports for these functions, ensuring they are enumerable and dynamically retrieved from the respective module. This is commonly used to maintain export structure and enable the use of getters for potentially dynamic values.

Below is a rewritten version of the code using the `export` syntax which is more modern and concise:

```javascript
"use strict";

import { 
  isIdentifierChar as _isIdentifierChar, 
  isIdentifierName as _isIdentifierName, 
  isIdentifierStart as _isIdentifierStart 
} from './identifier.js';

import {
  isKeyword as _isKeyword,
  isReservedWord as _isReservedWord,
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord as _isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord,
  isStrictBindReservedWord as _isStrictBindReservedWord,
  isStrictReservedWord as _isStrictReservedWord
} from './keyword.js';

export const isIdentifierChar = _isIdentifierChar;
export const isIdentifierName = _isIdentifierName;
export const isIdentifierStart = _isIdentifierStart;
export const isKeyword = _isKeyword;
export const isReservedWord = _isReservedWord;
export const isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord = _isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord;
export const isStrictBindReservedWord = _isStrictBindReservedWord;
export const isStrictReservedWord = _isStrictReservedWord;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

This version achieves the same end result as the original by simply exporting the imported modules directly using named exports.

The Node.js code provided is using ECMAScript 5 (ES5) syntax to define and export a series of function references from modules named `identifier.js` and `keyword.js`. The code primarily does the following:

1. Ensures the code runs in strict mode, a mode that helps catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.
2. Imports certain functions from the `identifier.js` and `keyword.js` modules.
3. Creates exports for several functionsâ€”primarily related to language constructs (identifiers, keywords, and reserved words).
4. The exports are configured using `Object.defineProperty`, which allows for detailed control over the properties, such as their enumerability and getter functions. This is particularly useful for creating modular/scope-safe constructs in JavaScript.

The modernized version of this code using a more readable and contemporary syntax (ES6+) would be:

```javascript
"use strict";

import { 
  isIdentifierChar, 
  isIdentifierName, 
  isIdentifierStart 
} from "./identifier.js";

import { 
  isKeyword, 
  isReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindReservedWord, 
  isStrictReservedWord 
} from "./keyword.js";

export { 
  isIdentifierChar, 
  isIdentifierName, 
  isIdentifierStart, 
  isKeyword, 
  isReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindOnlyReservedWord, 
  isStrictBindReservedWord, 
  isStrictReservedWord 
};

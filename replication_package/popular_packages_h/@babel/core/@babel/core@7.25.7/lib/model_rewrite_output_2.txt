The given Node.js code is structured using ECMAScript modules to export various functions, classes, constants, and other elements from the `babel` toolchain. Here is a summary of what the code is doing:

1. **Establishing Exports:** 
   - The code uses `Object.defineProperty` to define multiple exports on the `exports` object. These properties include functions and constants from different modules the code imports. 
   - Each exported property includes `enumerable: true`, allowing properties to be enumerated during iteration. A specific getter function is also defined to return the value for each property.

2. **Module Imports and Exports:**
   - The code imports functions and other entities from various internal modules (e.g., `transformation/file/file.js`, `tools/build-external-helpers.js`, etc.), as well as external packages such as `@babel/types`, `@babel/parser`, `@babel/traverse`, and `@babel/template`. 
   - It provides export points for these imports so that they can be accessed by other modules that import this script.

3. **Constants and Classes:**
   - `DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS` is a constant that holds an array of default file extensions used by Babel.
   - There's a nested `exports` object where `OptionManager` and `Plugin` are defined. The `OptionManager` class has an `init` method using `loadOptionsSync`, and `Plugin` seems to be a placeholder function throwing an error if used with an unsupported Babel version.
   - The `version` is exported with a string value "7.25.7".

Below is a rewritten version of the given code, keeping the functionality intact.

```js
"use strict";

// Export constants and version
export const DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS = Object.freeze([".js", ".jsx", ".es6", ".es", ".mjs", ".cjs"]);
export const version = "7.25.7";

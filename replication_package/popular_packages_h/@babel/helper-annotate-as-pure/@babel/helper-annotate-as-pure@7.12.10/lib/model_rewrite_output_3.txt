The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function `annotateAsPure`. This function is used to annotate a given AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) node with a `#__PURE__` comment, which is a hint used by some JavaScript minifiers to perform additional optimizations by assuming that the nodes it's attached to can be safely removed if their results are not used. This can be significant in removing side-effect-free code to potentially reduce the bundle size.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. **Module Export Definition**: Defines a default export for the `annotateAsPure` function.
2. **Importing Babel Types**: Uses Babel's types to interact with AST nodes. The `_interopRequireWildcard` function is utilized to handle this import in an environment that doesn't natively support ES Modules.
3. **Functionality**:
   - **`PURE_ANNOTATION` Constant**: Defines the string `#__PURE__`.
   - **`isPureAnnotated` Function**: Checks if a node already has a `#__PURE__` comment in its leading comments.
   - **`annotateAsPure` Function**:
     - Accepts a path or node.
     - Checks if the node is already annotated as pure.
     - If not, uses Babel's `addComment` to add the pure annotation to the node.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
exports.default = annotateAsPure;

const t = require("@babel/types");

function annotateAsPure(pathOrNode) {
  const node = pathOrNode.node || pathOrNode;

  const alreadyAnnotated = node.leadingComments && node.leadingComments.some(comment => /[@#]__PURE__/.test(comment.value));

  if (alreadyAnnotated) {
    return;
  }

  t.addComment(node, "leading", "#__PURE__");
}
```

This rewritten code simplifies the import process and cleans up the pure annotation check, while retaining the core functionality described earlier.

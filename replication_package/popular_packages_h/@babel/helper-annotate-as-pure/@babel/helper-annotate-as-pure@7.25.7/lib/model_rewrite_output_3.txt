The Node.js code is a module for annotating AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes as "pure". In programming, a "pure" function is one that does not cause side effects and returns the same output for the same input. This module is part of a Babel plugin or similar library, focusing on working with AST nodes during code transformations. 

The key functionality includes:

1. Importing `addComment` from `@babel/types`, a library for working with Babel's AST structures. 

2. Using a constant `PURE_ANNOTATION` defined as "#__PURE__" that will be used for commenting nodes.

3. Defining a helper function `isPureAnnotated` to check if a node already has a "pure" annotation as part of its leading comments.

4. Defining the `annotateAsPure` function, which checks if a given node or path is already annotated as "pure". If it's not annotated, the function adds a `PURE_ANNOTATION` as a leading comment to the node.

5. Exporting the `annotateAsPure` function as the default export of the module.

Rewritten code:

```javascript
"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});

exports.default = annotateAsPure;

const { addComment } = require("@babel/types");

const PURE_ANNOTATION = "#__PURE__";

const isPureAnnotated = node => {
  const { leadingComments } = node;
  return !!leadingComments && leadingComments.some(comment => /[@#]__PURE__/.test(comment.value));
};

function annotateAsPure(pathOrNode) {
  const node = pathOrNode.node || pathOrNode;
  if (!isPureAnnotated(node)) {
    addComment(node, "leading", PURE_ANNOTATION);
  }
}
```

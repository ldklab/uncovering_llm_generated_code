The provided Node.js code module exports several utilities for building and formatting different programming constructs. It imports "formatters" and a "_builder" function from external files and then uses "_builder" to create specific builders for different constructs such as "smart", "statement", "statements", "expression", and "program". These are likely functions or objects that help in creating or transforming code structures in some manner.

Finally, the module exports a default object that is a composite of the "smart" builder, which is bound to "undefined", and also includes references to each of the specific builders along with their functionalities, potentially aiding in abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulations.

Here is the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});

const formatters = require("./formatters.js");
const buildUsingDefault = require("./builder.js").default;

const smart = buildUsingDefault(formatters.smart);
const statement = buildUsingDefault(formatters.statement);
const statements = buildUsingDefault(formatters.statements);
const expression = buildUsingDefault(formatters.expression);
const program = buildUsingDefault(formatters.program);

exports.smart = smart;
exports.statement = statement;
exports.statements = statements;
exports.expression = expression;
exports.program = program;

exports.default = Object.assign(smart.bind(undefined), {
  smart,
  statement,
  statements,
  expression,
  program,
  ast: smart.ast
});
```

The provided Node.js code defines a module that exports multiple functions related to code formatting or building. These functions are: `smart`, `statement`, `statements`, `expression`, and `program`. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Import Dependencies**:
   - The module imports everything from `./formatters` using `_interopRequireWildcard`, likely containing various formatters functions.
   - It also imports a default function from `./builder` which seems to be a function factoryâ€”accepting a formatter and returning a new function.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `_interopRequireDefault` and `_interopRequireWildcard` are utility functions used for handling `require` operations, especially when importing ES6 modules in a CommonJS environment.

3. **Builder Function Calls**:
   - The code creates `smart`, `statement`, `statements`, `expression`, and `program` by calling the builder function and passing in respective formatters (i.e., `formatters.smart`, `formatters.statement`, etc.).

4. **Exports**:
   - The individual functions created (smart, statement, statements, expression, program) are exported.
   - `smart` is extended with all the created functions, including `smart.ast`, and set as the default export of the module. This involves the use of `Object.assign` to augment `smart` with additional properties.

Here's a possible rewrite of the provided code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import * as formatters from "./formatters";
import builder from "./builder";

const smart = builder(formatters.smart);
const statement = builder(formatters.statement);
const statements = builder(formatters.statements);
const expression = builder(formatters.expression);
const program = builder(formatters.program);

const exportsObject = {
  smart,
  statement,
  statements,
  expression,
  program,
  ast: smart.ast
};

exports.default = Object.assign(smart.bind(undefined), exportsObject);
export { smart, statement, statements, expression, program };
```

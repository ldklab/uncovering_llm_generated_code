The given Node.js code is part of a module that exports functionalities related to elliptic curve cryptography. The code sets up an `elliptic` object, which is also the module's export, by attaching various properties and modules related to elliptic curve operations. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. It uses strict mode to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript.
2. An `elliptic` object is created and exported.
3. The module's version is obtained from a `package.json` file and attached to the `elliptic.version` property.
4. It includes several utility modules and libraries, addressing purposes such as random number generation (`brorand`), mathematical curve operations, and specific protocols like EC (Elliptic Curve) and EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm), and attaches these to the `elliptic` object.
   
The rewritten code organizes this setup process similarly, maintaining the order and logic.

```javascript
'use strict';

const elliptic = exports;

elliptic.version = require('../package.json').version;
elliptic.utils = require('./elliptic/utils');
elliptic.rand = require('brorand');
elliptic.curve = require('./elliptic/curve');
elliptic.curves = require('./elliptic/curves');

// Protocols
elliptic.ec = require('./elliptic/ec');
elliptic.eddsa = require('./elliptic/eddsa');
```

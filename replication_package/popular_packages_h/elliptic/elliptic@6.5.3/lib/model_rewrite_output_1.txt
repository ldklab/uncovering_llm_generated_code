The given Node.js code is a module initialization script for the `elliptic` library, which is an implementation of elliptic curve cryptography in JavaScript. 

Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:
1. It initializes a `elliptic` object to export various components and properties.
2. The `elliptic.version` is assigned the current version of the package by requiring the version from `package.json`.
3. Utility functions are added to the elliptic object by requiring them from `./elliptic/utils`.
4. A random number generator, `brorand`, is required and attached to `elliptic.rand`.
5. Curve functionalities are imported from two different files: `curve` and `curves`, which handle elliptic curve operations and predefined curves respectively.
6. The `elliptic` object exports specific cryptographic protocols for elliptic curves: `ec` (Elliptic Curve protocol) and `eddsa` (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm).

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Define and export the elliptic object with various components
var elliptic = exports;

// Export the current version of the package
elliptic.version = require('../package.json').version;

// Add utility functions to the elliptic object
elliptic.utils = require('./elliptic/utils');

// Attach a random number generator to the elliptic object
elliptic.rand = require('brorand');

// Import curve functionalities and add them to the elliptic object
elliptic.curve = require('./elliptic/curve');
elliptic.curves = require('./elliptic/curves');

// Import and export cryptographic protocols for elliptic curves
elliptic.ec = require('./elliptic/ec');
elliptic.eddsa = require('./elliptic/eddsa');
```

The Node.js code is a module that exports various cryptographic functionalities under an `elliptic` namespace. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Namespace Initialization**: It initializes an `elliptic` object that will hold various cryptographic methods and utilities.

2. **Versioning**: It assigns a version number by requiring the version from a `package.json` file, indicating the module version.

3. **Utilities**: It adds a utility module which probably includes helper functions to be used throughout the `elliptic` functionalities.

4. **Random Number Generation**: It uses 'brorand', a library for generating cryptographic random numbers.

5. **Curve Support**: It requires modules for handling elliptic curves, which provide the mathematical foundation for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

6. **Protocols**: The module supports specific elliptic curve protocols namely EC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) by requiring these protocols and adding them to the `elliptic` namespace.

Below is the rewritten code according to the above explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const elliptic = exports;

elliptic.version = require('../package.json').version;
elliptic.utils = require('./elliptic/utils');
elliptic.rand = require('brorand');
elliptic.curve = require('./elliptic/curve');
elliptic.curves = require('./elliptic/curves');

// Protocols for elliptic curve cryptography
elliptic.ec = require('./elliptic/ec');
elliptic.eddsa = require('./elliptic/eddsa');
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that imports and organizes IPv4 and IPv6 functionality from different files, and then exports certain parts of this functionality for use in other files. Its key functionalities are:

1. Importing `Address4` from `"./lib/ipv4"` and exporting it as `Address4`.
2. Importing `Address6` from `"./lib/ipv6"` and exporting it as `Address6`.
3. Importing all exports from `"./lib/v6/helpers"` as a namespace and exporting this namespace as `v6.helpers`.

The code uses some helper functions to mimic TypeScript's module handling in JavaScript, specifically for creating bindings and setting defaults when a module doesn't directly export with ES6 syntax.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.v6 = exports.Address6 = exports.Address4 = void 0;

const { Address4 } = require("./lib/ipv4");
const { Address6 } = require("./lib/ipv6");
const helpers = require("./lib/v6/helpers");

exports.Address4 = Address4;
exports.Address6 = Address6;
exports.v6 = { helpers };
```

This rewritten code directly uses Node.js's `require` and `exports`, simplifying the module's import and export process without manually defining properties. The functionality remains the same as the original code, effectively exporting the necessary components for use elsewhere.

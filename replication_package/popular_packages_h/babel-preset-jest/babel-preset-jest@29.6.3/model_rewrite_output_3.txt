The provided Node.js code defines a Jest preset configuration for Babelâ€”a JavaScript compiler. This configuration is composed of plugins and presets that are required to transform the code to be compatible with the current Node.js syntax. Specifically:

1. `jestPreset` is an object that contains two properties:
   - `plugins`: An array that includes the resolved path to 'babel-plugin-jest-hoist'. This plugin is necessary for ensuring Jest's mocks are properly hoisted.
   - `presets`: An array that includes the resolved path to 'babel-preset-current-node-syntax'. This preset lets Babel handle the current Node.js syntax properly.

2. Since `@babel/core` expects module exports to be a function, the code exports a function that returns the `jestPreset` object when called.

Here is a possible rewrite for this Node.js code:

```javascript
const jestConfig = {
  plugins: [require.resolve('babel-plugin-jest-hoist')],
  presets: [require.resolve('babel-preset-current-node-syntax')],
};

module.exports = function() {
  return jestConfig;
};
```

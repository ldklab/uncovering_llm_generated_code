The given Node.js code exports a configuration function for Babel, specifically for Jest. The code defines a constant `jestPreset` that holds Babel configuration options tailored for Jest's usage.

- `plugins`: It includes an array of plugins with one element: 'babel-plugin-jest-hoist'. This plugin helps to ensure that imports, requires, and jest.mock calls are hoisted (i.e., moved to the top of the file), which is necessary for Jest to function correctly.

- `presets`: It includes an array of presets that consists of 'babel-preset-current-node-syntax'. This preset is used to enable Babel to understand current Node.js code syntax, allowing it to parse and transform the syntax as needed for the environment Jest tests in.

The module exports a function that, when called, returns the `jestPreset` configuration object. This is necessary as `@babel/core` requires the export to be a function when dealing with a Babel configuration.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const plugins = [require.resolve('babel-plugin-jest-hoist')];
const presets = [require.resolve('babel-preset-current-node-syntax')];

const jestPreset = {
  plugins,
  presets,
};

function getJestPreset() {
  return jestPreset;
}

module.exports = getJestPreset;
```

The Node.js code provided is a configuration file for Babel, specifically designed to be used in a Jest testing environment. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Jest Preset Configuration**: The code is defining a preset configuration object named `jestPreset`.
   - **`plugins` Property**: An array containing the Babel plugin `babel-plugin-jest-hoist`, which is used to transform Jest code by hoisting `jest.mock` calls to the top of the module.
   - **`presets` Property**: An array containing the Babel preset `babel-preset-current-node-syntax`, which allows Babel to understand the current Node.js syntax.

2. **Exporting as a Function**: Due to Babel's requirement that configuration be exported as a function, the code defines and exports an anonymous function that returns the `jestPreset` object.

This code is useful for setting up Babel to correctly process and transform code when running Jest tests, ensuring that all necessary transformations are applied for the current Node.js environment and that Jest-specific behaviors are supported.

```javascript
const getJestBabelPreset = () => {
  return {
    plugins: [require.resolve('babel-plugin-jest-hoist')],
    presets: [require.resolve('babel-preset-current-node-syntax')],
  };
};

module.exports = getJestBabelPreset;
```

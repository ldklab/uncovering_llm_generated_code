The provided code is a Node.js module that exports a function. This function, when invoked, returns an object named `jestPreset`. The `jestPreset` object contains configurations used by Babel, a JavaScript compiler. There are two properties in this object:

1. `plugins`: An array with a single resolved plugin, `babel-plugin-jest-hoist`, which is used to ensure jest specific code is hoisted correctly during the transformation.

2. `presets`: An array with a single resolved preset, `babel-preset-current-node-syntax`, which allows Babel to parse the current JavaScript syntax supported by Node.js.

The comment states that `@babel/core` requires the configuration setup to be exported as a function, hence the module exports a function returning the `jestPreset` object.

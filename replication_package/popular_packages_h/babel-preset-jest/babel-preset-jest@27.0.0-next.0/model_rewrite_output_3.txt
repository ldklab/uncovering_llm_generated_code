The Node.js code provided is defining a module that exports a function. When this function is invoked, it returns a configuration object called `jestPreset`. This object contains two properties:

1. `plugins`: An array including a resolved path to a Babel plugin called `babel-plugin-jest-hoist`. This plugin is used to handle mock hoisting in Jest testing.

2. `presets`: An array including a resolved path to a Babel preset called `babel-preset-current-node-syntax`. This preset is likely used to ensure that the syntax available in the current version of Node.js is understood by Babel.

The code makes use of `require.resolve` to ensure that the module paths are resolved correctly based on the current project structure. The function export is necessary because `@babel/core` expects such a pattern for Babel configuration files.

```javascript
const jestPreset = {
  plugins: [require.resolve('babel-plugin-jest-hoist')],
  presets: [require.resolve('babel-preset-current-node-syntax')],
};

module.exports = () => {
  return jestPreset;
};
```

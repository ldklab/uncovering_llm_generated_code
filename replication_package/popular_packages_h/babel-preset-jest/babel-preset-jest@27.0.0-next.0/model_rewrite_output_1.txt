The provided Node.js code defines a Jest preset for configuring Babel with specific plugins and preset options. In this context:

- It specifies the use of a particular Babel plugin called `babel-plugin-jest-hoist`, which is typically used to hoist `jest.mock` calls to the top of the file, enabling Jest to properly mock modules.
- It also uses a Babel preset `babel-preset-current-node-syntax` to transform the code to syntax that is compatible with the current version of Node.js.
- The `jestPreset` configuration is encapsulated in an object containing plugins and presets.
- The module exports a function that returns this `jestPreset`, which is required by `@babel/core` when defining a preset.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code following the explanation:

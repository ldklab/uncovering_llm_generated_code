The given Node.js code exports a module that conditionally sets the module's exports based on the Node.js process version. If it is running on older versions (v0.x.x or v1.x.x except v1.8.x), it exports an object with a custom `nextTick` function. The custom `nextTick` function mimics the behavior of Node.js's `process.nextTick` with handling up to three additional arguments that can be passed to the callback function. For newer versions, it simply exports the `process` object, relying on the native implementation of `process.nextTick`.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const shouldUseCustomNextTick = (typeof process === 'undefined' ||
    !process.version ||
    process.version.startsWith('v0.') ||
    (process.version.startsWith('v1.') && !process.version.startsWith('v1.8.')));

module.exports = shouldUseCustomNextTick ? { nextTick: customNextTick } : process;

function customNextTick(fn, ...args) {
  if (typeof fn !== 'function') {
    throw new TypeError('"callback" argument must be a function');
  }
  process.nextTick(() => fn(...args));
}
```

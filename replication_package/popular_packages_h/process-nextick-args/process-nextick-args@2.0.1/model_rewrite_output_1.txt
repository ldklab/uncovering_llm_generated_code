The provided Node.js code checks the Node.js environment version to determine whether or not to use the built-in `process` object or fall back to a custom `nextTick` function. If the Node.js version is older than v1.8, it exports a custom `nextTick` function; otherwise, it exports the entire `process` object. The `nextTick` function ensures that a given callback function is scheduled to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. It supports passing up to three arguments to the callback by creating closures that bind the arguments to the function. If more than three arguments are provided, it uses the `apply` method to pass them to the callback.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const shouldUseCustomNextTick = (typeof process === 'undefined' ||
  !process.version ||
  process.version.startsWith('v0.') ||
  (process.version.startsWith('v1.') && !process.version.startsWith('v1.8.')));

module.exports = shouldUseCustomNextTick ? { nextTick } : process;

function nextTick(fn, ...args) {
  if (typeof fn !== 'function') {
    throw new TypeError('"callback" argument must be a function');
  }

  process.nextTick(() => fn(...args));
}
```

The Node.js code is essentially exporting whatever is exported by the `./dist` module. It allows the current module to serve as a proxy for the module located at `./dist`. This means that when another module requires this module, it will actually be requiring the `./dist` module. It is a common practice when you have separate source and distribution files, and you want to expose only the built files or bundle in the `dist` directory.

Here is the rewritten code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const distModule = require('./dist');
module.exports = distModule;
```

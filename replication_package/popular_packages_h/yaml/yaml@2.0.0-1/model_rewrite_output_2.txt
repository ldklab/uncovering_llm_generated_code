The functionality of the Node.js code provided is to export the contents of a module located in the `./dist` directory. When this code is required in another file, it effectively imports whatever is being exported from the `./dist` module. In this context, `./dist` usually refers to a directory that contains the transpiled or compiled version of source files, which is commonly generated using build tools such as Babel, TypeScript, or Webpack.

Below is the possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
const distModule = require('./dist');

module.exports = distModule;
```

The provided Node.js code is setting up a module that exposes a global polyfill function as its main export. The process can be broken down as follows:

1. It begins by importing three modules: `define-properties`, which is used to define properties on objects; `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim` from local files which are presumably related polyfill functionalities or configurations.

2. `getPolyfill` is invoked to obtain the actual polyfill function that will be used.

3. A function `getGlobal` is defined which returns the polyfill obtained from `getPolyfill`.

4. `defineProperties` is used to add additional properties to the `getGlobal` function:
   - `getPolyfill`: points to the imported `getPolyfill` function.
   - `implementation`: points to the imported `implementation`.
   - `shim`: points to the imported `shim`.

5. Finally, the `getGlobal` function, complete with its additional properties, is exported as the module's exported value.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = getPolyfill();

const getGlobal = () => polyfill;

defineProperties(getGlobal, {
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    implementation: implementation,
    shim: shim
});

module.exports = getGlobal;
```

The code provided is a Node.js module that serves to set up and export a function related to polyfills. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The code uses `require` to import several modules: `define-properties`, an `implementation` module, a `polyfill` module, and a `shim` module.
2. It retrieves the polyfill function by calling `getPolyfill()`.
3. Defines a function `getGlobal` that simply returns the `polyfill`.
4. Uses `defineProperties` to augment the `getGlobal` function with additional properties: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`.
5. Exports the `getGlobal` function which now also has other properties attached to it as defined in step 4.

The overall functionality is to create and export a function that provides a polyfill, and it can also access the underlying implementation, polyfill method, and any associated shim process.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = getPolyfill();

const getGlobal = () => polyfill;

defineProperties(getGlobal, {
    getPolyfill,
    implementation,
    shim,
});

module.exports = getGlobal;
```

The Node.js code provided primarily sets up a module that exports a function. This function, when invoked, returns a polyfill. The core purpose of the code is to ensure that the function exported includes properties for accessing the polyfill, its implementation details, and a shim function.

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Imports**: The code imports three dependencies using `require`. `define-properties` is used for adding properties with defined attributes to an object. The other three are custom modules corresponding to the implementation of a feature, a polyfill for it, and a shim.

2. **Polyfill Initialization**: The `polyfill` variable is initialized by calling `getPolyfill()`, which likely checks whether the native implementation of the functionality exists and returns the appropriate fallback if it doesn't.

3. **Global Getter Function**: `getGlobal` is a function that returns the `polyfill` when invoked.

4. **Define Properties**: Properties `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` are added to the `getGlobal` function. This uses `defineProperties` to make these properties available with specific descriptors (likely non-enumerable and/or read-only).

5. **Export**: The module exports the `getGlobal` function, now enhanced with the added properties.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = getPolyfill();

const getGlobal = () => polyfill;

defineProperties(getGlobal, {
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    implementation: implementation,
    shim: shim
});

module.exports = getGlobal;
```

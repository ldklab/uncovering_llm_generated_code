The original Node.js code is designed to export the built-in `process` object from Node.js. The `process` object provides information and control over the current Node.js process. By using `module.exports`, the `process` object becomes accessible from other files that require this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Exporting the built-in process object from Node.js to make it available to other modules.
module.exports = process;
```

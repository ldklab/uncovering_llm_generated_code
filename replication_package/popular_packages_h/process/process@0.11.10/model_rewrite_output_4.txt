The given Node.js code is a simple module export. It exports Node.js's built-in `process` global object, which is a property of the global object in Node.js. This object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. 

Here's the code rewritten with the same functionality:

```javascript
// Export the built-in process object from Node.js
exports.process = require('process');
```

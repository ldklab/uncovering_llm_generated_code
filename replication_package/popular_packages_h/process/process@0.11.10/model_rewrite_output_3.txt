The Node.js code provided is a simple module that exposes the built-in `process` global object from Node.js. The `process` object provides information and control over the current Node.js process, and it's available globally in Node.js applications. By using `module.exports = global.process;`, the code exports the `process` object so that when this module is imported into another file, the importing file will have access to the `process` object.

Here is a possible rewrite for the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Export the built-in process object from Node.js global
module.exports = process;
```

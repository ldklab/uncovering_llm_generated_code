The Node.js code provided exports the global `process` object. The `process` object is a built-in Node.js variable that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. By assigning `global.process` to `module.exports`, the code allows other modules/files to import and use the `process` object directly without needing to access it through `global`.

A possible rewrite of the code could be:

```javascript
// Export the built-in Node.js 'process' object
module.exports = require('process');
```

This rewritten code directly requires the 'process' module, which effectively serves the same purpose by providing access to the `process` object. Note that in Node.js, `require('process')` returns the same `process` object as `global.process`.

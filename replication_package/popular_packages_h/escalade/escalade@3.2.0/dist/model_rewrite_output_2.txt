The provided Node.js code is an asynchronous function that searches upwards in directory hierarchy from a starting directory. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Imports**: The code imports `dirname` and `resolve` from the `path` module, and `readdir` and `stat` from the `fs` module. It also imports `promisify` from the `util` module.

2. **Promisify**: The `stat` and `readdir` functions are converted into promise-based functions `toStats` and `toRead` using `promisify`. This allows the use of `async/await` with these functions.

3. **Function Export**: The module exports an asynchronous function that accepts two arguments: `start`, the initial directory to begin searching from, and `callback`, a function to be called at each directory level.

4. **Resolve Start Directory**: The starting directory path is resolved from the current directory to an absolute path with `resolve`.

5. **Ensure Directory**: It checks if the resolved path is a directory. If not, it uses `dirname` to step back to the parent directory to ensure a valid directory path.

6. **Upward Directory Traversal**: It enters a `while (true)` loop where it:
   - Uses the `callback` function with the current directory and the list of directory contents (retrieved by `toRead`) and stores the result in `tmp`.
   - If `tmp` is truthy, it resolves the current directory path with `tmp` and returns it, exiting the function.
   - Steps back up the directory tree using `dirname` and assigns the new parent directory to `dir`.
   - If it reaches the root directory (`tmp === dir`), the loop breaks, and the function ends without a return, implying undefined is returned.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```js
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs').promises;

module.exports = async function searchUpwards(start, callback) {
    let currentDir = path.resolve('.', start);

    try {
        let stats = await fs.stat(currentDir);
        if (!stats.isDirectory()) {
            currentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);
        }

        while (true) {
            const files = await fs.readdir(currentDir);
            const result = await callback(currentDir, files);
            if (result) {
                return path.resolve(currentDir, result);
            }
            const parentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);
            if (currentDir === parentDir) {
                break;
            }
            currentDir = parentDir;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);
    }
};
```

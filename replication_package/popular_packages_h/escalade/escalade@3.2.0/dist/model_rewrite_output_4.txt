The given Node.js code exports an asynchronous function that traverses up the directory hierarchy starting from a specified `start` directory. It does so by repeatedly moving to the parent directory of the current directory. The function takes two parameters: `start`, which is the starting directory path, and `callback`, which is a function that is called with each directory's path and contents.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It resolves the starting directory path to an absolute path.
2. It checks if this path is a directory using `fs.stat`.
3. If it's not a directory, it changes the starting path to the parent directory.
4. It enters a loop where it repeatedly:
   - Calls the `callback` function, providing it with the current directory's path and the names of the files within that directory (using `fs.readdir`).
   - If the callback function returns a truthy value, it returns the resolved path of the directory combined with this value.
   - If the callback doesn't return a truthy value, it continues the traversal by moving to the parent directory of the current directory.
   - The loop will only stop if it has traversed up to the root directory and can't move further upwards.

The code employs the `util.promisify` method to convert the callback-based `fs.stat` and `fs.readdir` functions into Promises, allowing for the use of `async/await` syntax.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const { dirname, resolve } = require('path');
const { readdir, stat } = require('fs').promises;

module.exports = async function traverseDirectories(start, callback) {
    let dir = resolve('.', start);

    try {
        let stats = await stat(dir);

        if (!stats.isDirectory()) {
            dir = dirname(dir);
        }

        while (true) {
            const files = await readdir(dir);
            const result = await callback(dir, files);
            if (result) return resolve(dir, result);

            const parentDir = dirname(dir);
            if (parentDir === dir) break;
            dir = parentDir;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error traversing directories:', error);
    }
}
```

The given Node.js code is performing several operations related to module imports and exports. Here is a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Helper Functions**: The code defines helper functions `__createBinding`, `__setModuleDefault`, `__importStar`, and `__exportStar`. These are used to manage the import/export process, especially when dealing with CommonJS and ES Modules interop.

   - `__createBinding`: Creates a binding on the target object to a property of the module.
   - `__setModuleDefault`: Sets the default property for the module.
   - `__importStar`: Imports all properties of a module and assigns to a variable.
   - `__exportStar`: Re-exports all properties from one module to another.

2. **Import and Export Operations**:
   - The `__importStar` helper is used to import all exports from `./external` module and assign them to a variable `z`.
   - The variable `z` is exported as a named export.
   - `__exportStar` is used to re-export all bindings from `./external` as part of the current module's exports.
   - The variable `z` is also set as the default export of this module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code using modern JavaScript syntax without the manual helper functions:

```javascript
"use strict";
import * as z from './external';
export * from './external';
export { z };
export default z;
```

The provided Node.js code is using TypeScript syntax to manage module imports and exports. Let's break down its functionality:

1. **Binding and defaults setup**: The code includes polyfills (`__createBinding`, `__setModuleDefault`) for older JavaScript environments that do not support ES6-style module imports and exports, allowing for compatibility.

2. **Importing with `__importStar`**: This function imports all exported members from a module. In this case, it imports everything from the `./external` module as `z`, handling both named and default exports appropriately.

3. **Exporting members with `__exportStar`**: This function re-exports all non-default exports from the `./external` module, making them part of the current module's export interface, except for the default export.

4. **Named and default exports**: The module exports:
   - `z` as a named export.
   - All named exports from `./external` through `__exportStar`.
   - `z` is also set as the default export for this module.

Here's a possible rewrite for the code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.z = void 0;

const z = require("./external");
exports.z = z;

for (const key in z) {
    if (key !== "default" && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(z, key)) {
        exports[key] = z[key];
    }
}

exports.default = z;
```

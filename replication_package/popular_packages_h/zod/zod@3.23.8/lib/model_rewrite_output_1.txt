The Node.js code provided is a module that imports all exports from another module located in a file named `external`. It uses some TypeScript-like helper functions to handle module imports and exports. The code first creates a namespace `z` for all exports from `external` using `__importStar`, then exports this namespace (`exports.z = z`). It also re-exports all non-default exports from `external` using `__exportStar`, and finally sets the default export of this module to be `z`.

Here's a simplified rewrite of this functionality in modern Node.js:

```javascript
"use strict";

const z = require("./external");
Object.assign(exports, z);
exports.z = z;
exports.default = z;
```

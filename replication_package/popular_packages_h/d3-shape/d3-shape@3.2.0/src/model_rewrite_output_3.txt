The Node.js code provided exports various modules from different files. Each export line is using the ES6 syntax to export a default or named module from a specific file. Here is a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Primary Exports:**
   - The main geometric shapes and data visualization utilities like `arc`, `area`, `line`, `pie`, `areaRadial`, `lineRadial`, and `pointRadial` are being exported as default from their respective files.

2. **Link Exports:**
   - Different link configurations like `linkHorizontal`, `linkVertical`, and `linkRadial` are named exports from the `link.js` file.

3. **Symbol Exports:**
   - Several symbol types, such as `symbolAsterisk`, `symbolCircle`, `symbolCross`, `symbolDiamond`, and others are being exported. These symbols represent various shapes which can be used in data visualizations.

4. **Curve Exports:**
   - Various curve configurations like `curveBasisClosed`, `curveCardinal`, `curveCatmullRom`, etc., are exported from different files. These manage different types of line curves used in graphics rendering.

5. **Stack and Offset Exports:**
   - `stack` is a utility to stack data, and various stack offset and order configurations like `stackOffsetExpand`, `stackOrderAppearance`, etc., are being exported to control how data is stacked or ordered for visualization.

6. **Deprecated Aliases:**
   - `radialArea` and `radialLine` suggest deprecated usage of `areaRadial` and `lineRadial` respectively, but are still provided for backward compatibility.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It uses strict mode and exports the built-in JavaScript `Object` constructor. This would allow other modules to import and use the `Object` directly from this module. The comment `/** @type {import('.')} */` is a JSDoc type declaration, which essentially serves as a placeholder or reminder that this module exports a type that can be imported from another module, though in this case it's exporting the `Object`.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Exporting the JavaScript Object constructor
module.exports = Object;
```

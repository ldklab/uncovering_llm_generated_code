The functionality of the given Node.js code is quite simple. It is exporting the built-in `Object` global from the module. The `Object` is a fundamental part of JavaScript, providing a set of utilities for creating objects and accessing their properties. This module exports `Object`, making it available for other files or modules to import and use the standard `Object` functionalities.

Now, here is the possible rewrite for the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Exporting the built-in JavaScript Object global
module.exports = Object;
```

The Node.js code provided is exporting the global `Object` rather than a custom or user-defined object. The use of `'use strict';` indicates that the code is being run in JavaScript's strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions. The line `/** @type {import('.')} */` is a JSDoc comment that suggests that the type information for the exported entity is being imported from the current directory. However, it's not affecting the code's functionality since this is just a comment and does not change the fact that `Object` is being exported.

In summary, the module is simply exporting JavaScript's built-in `Object` entity. Below is a rewritten version of this code, maintaining the same functionality.

```javascript
'use strict';

/** This module exports the built-in global Object */
module.exports = global.Object;
```

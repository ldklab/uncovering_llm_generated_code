The given Node.js code is a module that exports the built-in JavaScript `Object` constructor. It uses strict mode which helps in catching common coding errors and prevents accidental global variable declarations. The type annotation, `{import('.')}`, is a placeholder or reference indicating that this module is expected to export an object type based on the current module, though it essentially just exports the `Object` constructor.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

/**
 * @type {ObjectConstructor}
 * This module exports the JavaScript Object constructor.
 */
module.exports = Object;
```

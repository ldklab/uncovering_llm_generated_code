The provided Node.js code is exporting functionalities related to source maps, which are used for debugging. It involves three exports: `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode`, each sourced from their respective modules within a `lib` directory. These components likely serve different purposes related to working with source maps, such as generating, consuming, or constructing source maps programmatically. 

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require('./lib/source-map-generator');
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require('./lib/source-map-consumer');
const { SourceNode } = require('./lib/source-node');

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};
```

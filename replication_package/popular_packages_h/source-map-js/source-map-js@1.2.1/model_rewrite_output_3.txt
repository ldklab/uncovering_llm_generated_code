The given Node.js code is an export module script that imports specific classes or objects from different modules located in the `./lib` directory and then exports them so they can be used in other parts of the application. The specific functionalities that are being imported and exported are:

1. `SourceMapGenerator`: This probably deals with the creation or generation of source maps, which are files used to map code within a compressed file back to its original source, allowing for easier debugging.
2. `SourceMapConsumer`: This is likely used to interpret or analyze source maps, providing means to obtain the original position within the source file from a position in the generated file.
3. `SourceNode`: This may serve as a utility to work with nodes in the source map, linking generated code back to its original source and location.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript

const SourceMapGenerator = require('./lib/source-map-generator').SourceMapGenerator;
const SourceMapConsumer = require('./lib/source-map-consumer').SourceMapConsumer;
const SourceNode = require('./lib/source-node').SourceNode;

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode,
};
```

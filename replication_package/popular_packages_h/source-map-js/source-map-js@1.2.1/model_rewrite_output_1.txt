The Node.js code is exporting three modules related to source map functionality from separate files in the `lib` directory. These modules - `SourceMapGenerator`, `SourceMapConsumer`, and `SourceNode` - are likely classes or objects that help generate and consume source maps, which are used to map code from a source language (such as CoffeeScript or TypeScript) to a compiled or transformed version (such as JavaScript). These functionalities are typically used in debugging and development processes to map the transformed code back to the original source code.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require('./lib/source-map-generator');
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require('./lib/source-map-consumer');
const { SourceNode } = require('./lib/source-node');

exports.SourceMapGenerator = SourceMapGenerator;
exports.SourceMapConsumer = SourceMapConsumer;
exports.SourceNode = SourceNode;
```

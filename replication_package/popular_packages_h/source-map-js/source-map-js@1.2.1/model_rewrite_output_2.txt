The Node.js code is exporting functionality from separate modules within a source map library. Specifically, it exports three components:

1. `SourceMapGenerator`: This is likely a class or function responsible for creating source maps, which are files used to map transformed or compiled code back to the original source code.
2. `SourceMapConsumer`: This could be a class or function that helps read and utilize source maps to understand how the transformed code relates to the original code.
3. `SourceNode`: This is typically a utility that represents a segment of code with position information that can be used to generate source maps.

The modules for these components are located in the `lib` directory and are being exported from their respective files (`source-map-generator`, `source-map-consumer`, `source-node`) using the CommonJS module system, which is standard in Node.js.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const { SourceMapGenerator } = require('./lib/source-map-generator');
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require('./lib/source-map-consumer');
const { SourceNode } = require('./lib/source-node');

module.exports = {
  SourceMapGenerator,
  SourceMapConsumer,
  SourceNode
};
```

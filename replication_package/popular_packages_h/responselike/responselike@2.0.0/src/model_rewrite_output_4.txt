The given Node.js code defines a `Response` class extending the `Readable` stream. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Extends Readable Stream**: The `Response` class inherits from `stream.Readable`, allowing instances to be readable streams. This means instances can emit data in a way that is consumable by other Node.js stream consumers.

2. **Constructor Validation**: The constructor checks the following:
   - `statusCode` must be a number which represents the HTTP status code.
   - `headers` must be an object containing HTTP headers.
   - `body` must be a `Buffer`, which represents the body of the HTTP response.
   - `url` must be a string which represents the URL from which the response was received.

   If any of these validations fail, a `TypeError` is thrown, ensuring that the class is used with valid data.

3. **Lowercase Headers**: It uses the `lowercase-keys` module to convert all header keys to lowercase, ensuring header case insensitivity.

4. **Read Implementation**: The `_read()` method is overridden to push the `body` Buffer content to the stream followed by a `null`, indicating the end of the stream. This is essential for making the `Response` class work as a readable stream.

5. **Exports**: The `Response` class is exported as a module, which can then be used by other parts of the application to create readable stream instances representing HTTP response data.

Here's the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const { Readable } = require('stream');
const lowercaseKeys = require('lowercase-keys');

class Response extends Readable {
  constructor(statusCode, headers, body, url) {
    super();
    this.validateInputs(statusCode, headers, body, url);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.headers = lowercaseKeys(headers); // Ensures headers' keys are lowercase
    this.body = body;
    this.url = url;
  }

  validateInputs(statusCode, headers, body, url) {
    if (typeof statusCode !== 'number') {
      throw new TypeError('Argument `statusCode` should be a number');
    }
    if (typeof headers !== 'object' || headers === null) {
      throw new TypeError('Argument `headers` should be an object');
    }
    if (!(body instanceof Buffer)) {
      throw new TypeError('Argument `body` should be a buffer');
    }
    if (typeof url !== 'string') {
      throw new TypeError('Argument `url` should be a string');
    }
  }

  _read() {
    this.push(this.body);
    this.push(null); // Signify completion
  }
}

module.exports = Response;
```

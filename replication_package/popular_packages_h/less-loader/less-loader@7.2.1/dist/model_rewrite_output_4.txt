The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement that is importing the default export from the file "./index" and then re-exporting it. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its functionality:

1. `"use strict";` is a directive that activates strict mode in JavaScript, which helps to catch common errors by enforcing a stricter set of rules to improve code quality.

2. `require("./index")` is a function call that imports the module located in the file "index.js" from the current directory. The `require` function returns the module's exports.

3. `.default` accesses the default export from the imported module. In JavaScript ES6 modules, a module can have a default export, which is intended as the primary exported value of a module.

4. `module.exports =` assigns the default export of the imported module to `module.exports`, thereby re-exporting it. This means that any other module that imports this file will receive the default export from the "index.js" module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The Node.js code is a module that exports the default export from another module located in the same directory, specifically from a file named `index.js`. It does this by using `require` to load the module and then accessing its `default` property. This is a common pattern for integrating with ES6 modules in a CommonJS environment, where the `default` export from an ES6 module needs to be accessed and exported within a Node.js module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");

// Export the default export from the index module
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. `"use strict";` - This directive is used to enable strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding bugs, prevents the use of certain syntax considered to be error-prone, and makes the code adhere more closely to a more secure subset of JavaScript.

2. `module.exports = ...;` - This statement is used to export functionality from a module, enabling it to be imported and used in other files. In this specific code, the `module.exports` is set to export whatever is provided by the `default` property from another module.

3. `require("./index")` - This part imports the `index` module from the current directory. The imported module is expected to be either an object or a function that is exported by the `index.js` file in the same directory as the current module.

4. `.default` - This is used to access the `default` export from the module that has been imported. It is a common pattern when the original module was authored using ES6 module syntax but is being consumed with CommonJS-style imports, like using `require`.

Given the explanation, here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the `index` module from the current directory
const indexModule = require("./index");

// Export the `default` property of the imported module
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

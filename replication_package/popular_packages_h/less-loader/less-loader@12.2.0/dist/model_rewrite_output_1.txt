The given Node.js code is a very simple module export statement. It exports the default export from the "index" module located in the same directory. Here's the line-by-line breakdown:

1. `"use strict";`: This line enables strict mode, a JavaScript feature that helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions, such as assigning values to undeclared variables.

2. `module.exports = require("./index").default;`: This line exports the default export from the module located in the same directory as this script. It uses Node.js's `require` function to load the module found in "index", and then it accesses the `.default` property of the exported object from that module to assign it to `module.exports`. This means any consumer of this module will receive whatever is exported as the default from the "index" module.

Here's a rewritten version of the code maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

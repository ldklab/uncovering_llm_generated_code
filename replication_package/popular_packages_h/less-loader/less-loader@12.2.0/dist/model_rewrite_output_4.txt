The given Node.js code is a module that exports the default export from another module located in the same directory named `index.js`. It uses `require` to import the module and then accesses the `default` property, which is typically used when a module exports a single value as its default export. This is commonly seen in cases where the `index.js` file is exporting an ES6 module with a `default` export.

Here is a possible rewritten version of this code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It requires a module located in the same directory named "index" and then exports its default export. This is commonly used when the default export from a module needs to be directly re-exported from another module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module setup script for exporting three modules: `ast`, `code`, and `keyword`. It uses the CommonJS module system for requiring these modules and attaching them to the `exports` object, which makes them available for other files to import. The code is wrapped in an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) to encapsulate it and enforce 'strict mode'. The comments are license text permitting reuse and modification under specific conditions. Finally, there is a comment for configuring Vim editor settings.

Here's a rewritten version of the code that maintains the same functionality:

```javascript
// License Information
// This code is under the permissive BSD license allowing for redistribution and use with or without modifications.

(() => {
    'use strict';

    // Exporting required modules using CommonJS syntax
    module.exports = {
        ast: require('./ast'),
        code: require('./code'),
        keyword: require('./keyword')
    };
})();

// Vim configuration: set sw=4 ts=4 et tw=80
```

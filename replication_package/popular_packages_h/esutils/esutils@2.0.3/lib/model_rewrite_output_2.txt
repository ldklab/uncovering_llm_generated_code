The provided Node.js code is a module wrapper that exports three modules: `ast`, `code`, and `keyword` from their respective files located in the same directory. It utilizes the CommonJS module system, which is typical in Node.js environments, allowing other files or programs to import these modules. The code is kept in strict mode to enforce a cleaner version of JavaScript that catches common coding errors and prevents certain actions, enhancing overall code quality.

Below is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export modules using CommonJS syntax
exports.ast = require('./ast');
exports.code = require('./code');
exports.keyword = require('./keyword');

/**
 * This module provides access to 'ast', 'code', and 'keyword' by
 * requiring their respective files. It is designed to be used as a 
 * part of a Node.js application or library where these modules are 
 * needed. The use of 'use strict' directive ensures stricter parsing 
 * and error handling.

The given Node.js code is a module that imports several components from the `./lib` directory and attaches them to a main `async` object. The components imported are `core`, `is-core`, and `sync`, and they are set as properties of the `async` object. Finally, the `async` object, now containing these properties, is exported as a module. This pattern allows you to modularize code by grouping related functionality within an object and exporting it, so that it can be easily reused in other parts of the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Importing various components from the './lib' directory
const core = require('./lib/core');
const isCore = require('./lib/is-core');
const sync = require('./lib/sync');

// Creating an async object and assigning the imported components to it
const async = {
  core,
  isCore,
  sync,
};

// Exporting the async object as a module
module.exports = async;
```

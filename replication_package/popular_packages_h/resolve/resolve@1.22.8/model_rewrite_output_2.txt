The provided Node.js code is creating an `async` object by requiring a module located at `./lib/async`. It then enhances this `async` object by adding several properties to it, each corresponding to functionalities from other modules located at paths `./lib/core`, `./lib/is-core`, and `./lib/sync`. Finally, the augmented `async` object is exported as the module's interface, allowing other modules to use all the functionalities combined in this `async` object.

Here's the possible rewrite of the described functionality:

```javascript
// Import the base async functionality from ./lib/async
var async = require('./lib/async');

// Enhance the async object with additional functionalities
async.core = require('./lib/core');     // Add core functionalities
async.isCore = require('./lib/is-core'); // Add core-checking functionalities
async.sync = require('./lib/sync');     // Add synchronous functionalities

// Export the enhanced async object for use in other modules
module.exports = async;
```

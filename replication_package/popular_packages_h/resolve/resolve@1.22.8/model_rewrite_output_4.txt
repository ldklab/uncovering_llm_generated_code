The given Node.js code is a module that imports functionality from four different modules located in the `./lib/` directory. It first requires a module named `async` and then augments it by adding three properties to it - `core`, `isCore`, and `sync`, which are each assigned to corresponding modules. Finally, it exports the augmented `async` object, allowing these functionalities to be used wherever this module is imported.

Below is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import modules from the ./lib directory
const async = require('./lib/async');
const core = require('./lib/core');
const isCore = require('./lib/is-core');
const sync = require('./lib/sync');

// Enhance the async object with additional properties
async.core = core;
async.isCore = isCore;
async.sync = sync;

// Export the enhanced async object
module.exports = async;
```

The given Node.js code is importing several modules from a local './lib/' directory and then attaching these imported modules as properties to an object called `async`. Specifically, the properties added are `core`, `isCore`, and `sync`. Finally, the `async` object (with its newly attached properties) is exported as a module, making it available for import in other parts of the application.

Below is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const async = require('./lib/async');
const core = require('./lib/core');
const isCore = require('./lib/is-core');
const sync = require('./lib/sync');

async.core = core;
async.isCore = isCore;
async.sync = sync;

module.exports = async;
```

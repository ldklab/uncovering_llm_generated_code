The Node.js code is a simple module that imports some functionalities from multiple files located in a 'lib' directory and assigns them as properties to a single object, which is subsequently exported. Here's the breakdown of what each line does:

1. It imports a main object from 'lib/async'.
2. It enhances this main object by adding a property 'core' which is imported from 'lib/core'.
3. It adds another property 'isCore' to the main object, sourced from 'lib/is-core'.
4. It adds a third property 'sync' which is imported from 'lib/sync'.
5. Finally, it exports the enhanced object for use in other parts of the application.

Here is a rewritten version of the given code:

```javascript
// Import different functionalities from the 'lib' directory
const asyncFunctions = require('./lib/async');
const coreFunctions = require('./lib/core');
const isCoreFunction = require('./lib/is-core');
const syncFunctions = require('./lib/sync');

// Assign imported functionalities as properties to the main object
asyncFunctions.core = coreFunctions;
asyncFunctions.isCore = isCoreFunction;
asyncFunctions.sync = syncFunctions;

// Export the enhanced asyncFunctions object
module.exports = asyncFunctions;
```

The given Node.js code is importing several modules from a local library named `lib`. It combines these modules into a single `async` object with various properties and then exports this object for use in other parts of the application.

Here's a breakdown of what each line is doing:
1. The code imports a module from `./lib/async` and assigns it to a variable named `async`.
2. It adds a property `core` to the `async` object, which is imported from `./lib/core`.
3. It adds another property `isCore` to the `async` object, which is imported from `./lib/is-core`.
4. It adds a property `sync` to the `async` object, which is imported from `./lib/sync`.
5. Finally, the `async` object, now enriched with several properties, is exported from the module.

Here is the possible rewrite of the code based on the explanation:

```javascript
// Import and assign the main async module
const async = require('./lib/async');

// Enhance the async object with additional modules
async.core = require('./lib/core');      // Add core functionalities
async.isCore = require('./lib/is-core'); // Add isCore checker functionalities
async.sync = require('./lib/sync');      // Add synchronous functionalities

// Export the final async object for use in other modules
module.exports = async;
```

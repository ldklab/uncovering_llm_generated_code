The given Node.js code is setting up a modular structure for exporting functionalities related to asynchronous operations. It makes use of a custom library `async` that seems to have several components, each managed in separate modules. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. `var async = require('./lib/async');`: This imports the main `async` module from a file located at `./lib/async`.

2. `async.core = require('./lib/core');`: It imports a `core` module from `./lib/core` and assigns it as a property on the `async` object. This suggests that the core module likely contains essential functionalities related to asynchronous processing.

3. `async.isCore = require('./lib/is-core');`: This imports a module from `./lib/is-core` that seems to deal with checking core functionalities or validating core components, assigning it to the `async` object.

4. `async.sync = require('./lib/sync');`: Similarly, it imports another module from `./lib/sync` and assigns it to an `async.sync` property. The name suggests that this module deals with synchronous counterparts to the asynchronous operations.

5. `module.exports = async;`: This line exports the `async` object with all the added properties, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const async = require('./lib/async');
async.core = require('./lib/core');
async.isCore = require('./lib/is-core');
async.sync = require('./lib/sync');

module.exports = async;
```

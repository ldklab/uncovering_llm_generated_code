The provided Node.js code is essentially creating an `async` object that aggregates functionalities from several modules. The `async` object imports the base `async` functionality from a file located at './lib/async'. It then extends this object by attaching additional functionalities from three other modules (`core`, `is-core`, and `sync`) under their respective properties. All these modules are located in the './lib' directory, and the complete `async` object is then exported as a module. This allows other files to import this `async` object and leverage the combined functionality provided by the incorporated modules.

Here's the possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import the base async functionality from the './lib/async' module
let async = require('./lib/async');

// Extend the async object with additional functionalities
async.core = require('./lib/core');        // Attach 'core' functionality to async.core
async.isCore = require('./lib/is-core');   // Attach 'is-core' functionality to async.isCore
async.sync = require('./lib/sync');        // Attach 'sync' functionality to async.sync

// Export the configured async object to make it accessible in other files
module.exports = async;
```

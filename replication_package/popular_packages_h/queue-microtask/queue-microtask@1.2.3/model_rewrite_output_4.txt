The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function for deferring the execution of a callback using the microtask queue. This functionality is typically provided by `queueMicrotask`, but if it's not available, the module falls back on using a resolved `Promise` to achieve a similar effect. 

Here's how it works:
1. The code checks if `queueMicrotask` is available as a function in the current environment.
2. If `queueMicrotask` is available, it uses that native API, binding it correctly to either the `window` (in browsers) or `global` (in Node.js).
3. If `queueMicrotask` is not available, it falls back to using a resolved `Promise`. 
4. The fallback mechanism involves creating (or reusing) a resolved promise, calling `then` with the provided callback, and handling any potential errors by throwing them asynchronously.

Below is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
/*! queue-microtask. MIT License. Feross Aboukhadijeh <https://feross.org/opensource> */
let resolvedPromise;

module.exports = typeof queueMicrotask === 'function'
  ? queueMicrotask.bind(globalThis)
  : callback => {
      (resolvedPromise ||= Promise.resolve()).then(callback).catch(error => {
        setTimeout(() => { throw error; }, 0);
      });
    }
```

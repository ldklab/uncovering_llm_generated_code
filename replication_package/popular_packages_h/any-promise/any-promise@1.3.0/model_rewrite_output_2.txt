The Node.js code exports a specific property from a module which is located in the file `./register`. It calls (or invokes) a function that is exported by the `./register` module and expects that this invocation returns an object that has a `Promise` property. This `Promise` property is then what gets exported by the module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code with added context:

```javascript
// Import the module located in './register' and immediately invoke it as a function
const registerModule = require('./register')();

// Export the 'Promise' property from the result of invoking the 'registerModule'
module.exports = registerModule.Promise;
```

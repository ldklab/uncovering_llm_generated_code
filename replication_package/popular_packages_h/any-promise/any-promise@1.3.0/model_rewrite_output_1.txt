The provided Node.js code exports a `Promise` object which is obtained from calling a function exported by the `./register` module. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what is happening in the code:

1. `require('./register')`: The code requires the `./register` module, which is expected to export a function.
   
2. `()`: Immediately invokes the function obtained from the `require('./register')` call. This is known as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
   
3. `.Promise`: Accesses the `Promise` property of the object returned by the invoked function.

Essentially, this code exports a `Promise` which is expected to be part of the object returned by the function from the `./register` module.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const register = require('./register');
const result = register();
module.exports = result.Promise;
```

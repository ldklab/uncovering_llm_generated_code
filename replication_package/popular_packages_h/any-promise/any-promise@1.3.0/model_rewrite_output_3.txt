The Node.js code is exporting a `Promise` attribute from the result of invoking a function that is exported from a module located at `./register`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The `require('./register')` part imports the module located at `./register`.
2. This module is expected to export a function because the expression `require('./register')()` is invoking the result, which would typically be a function.
3. The returned object from this invoked function is expected to have a `Promise` attribute.
4. The `Promise` attribute of this returned object is then exported as the module export.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with this explanation in mind:

```javascript
const register = require('./register');

// Execute the function returned by the './register' module to get an object
const registerObject = register();

// Export the Promise attribute of the resulting object from invoking the function
module.exports = registerObject.Promise;
```

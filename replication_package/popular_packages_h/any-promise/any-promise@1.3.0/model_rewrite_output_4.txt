The provided Node.js code is responsible for exporting a specific component from a module. It does this by requiring a module located in a file named `register`, invokes it as a function, and then accesses the `Promise` property of the returned object. The result is that whatever the `Promise` property is of the returned object from `register`, it is what is being exported from the module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code broken down into more steps for clarity:

```javascript
// Require the ./register module
const registerModule = require('./register');

// Invoke the function returned from require('./register')
const result = registerModule();

// Extract the Promise property from the result
const promiseExport = result.Promise;

// Export the Promise property
module.exports = promiseExport;
```

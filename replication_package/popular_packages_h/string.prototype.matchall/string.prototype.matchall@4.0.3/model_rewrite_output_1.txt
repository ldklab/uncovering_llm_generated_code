The provided Node.js code creates a module that exports a function, `boundMatchAll`, which is a bound version of an `implementation` function, allowing it to be used as a method similar to a native one. It uses three imported modules:

1. `call-bind` to bind the `implementation` function to a context.
2. `define-properties` to add additional properties to the `boundMatchAll` function.
3. Two locally defined modules, `polyfill` and `shim`, are used along with the `implementation`.

The `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` are added as properties to the `boundMatchAll` function, offering additional functionality or alternatives.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const define = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundMatchAll = callBind(implementation);

define(boundMatchAll, {
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    implementation: implementation,
    shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundMatchAll;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that prepares a function, likely the ECMAScript `String.prototype.matchAll` method or similar, for use in environments that may not support it natively. The code does the following:

1. **Dependencies**: It requires several modules such as `call-bind`, `define-properties`, along with local modules `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`.

2. **Function Binding**: Uses `call-bind` to bind the `implementation`, which is expected to be a function or method, to create `boundMatchAll`. This ensures that it can be called with a specified `this` value.

3. **Properties Definition**: Utilizes `define-properties` to add properties `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` to `boundMatchAll`, making these utilities available as part of the module export.

4. **Module Export**: It exports the `boundMatchAll` function, which now carries additional methods to get a polyfill version, the implementation, and a shim function.

Below is a rewritten version of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Create a bound version of the implementation function
const boundMatchAll = callBind(implementation);

// Add additional utility properties to the exported function
defineProperties(boundMatchAll, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

// Export the prepared function with added utilities
module.exports = boundMatchAll;
```

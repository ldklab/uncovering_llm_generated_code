The given Node.js code is a module that provides a polyfill, i.e., it fills in functionality for environments that do not support certain features natively. The code does the following:

1. It imports necessary modules used to define properties, bind functions, and get the polyfill, implementation, and a shim.
2. It calls the `getPolyfill` function and binds it to the `Object` prototype using `callBind`. This effectively allows the polyfill method to be used as if it was a method on the `Object` prototype.
3. It defines properties on the created `polyfill` object, attaching the `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` functions to it. This makes these additional functions accessible on the `polyfill`.
4. Finally, it exports the `polyfill` object so that it can be utilized by other modules.

Here is the rewritten code incorporating these functionalities:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Create a polyfill by binding the `getPolyfill` to the `Object`, allowing it to be called as a method of `Object`.
const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

// Define additional properties on the polyfill object, making them accessible.
defineProperties(polyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

// Export the polyfill object for use in other parts of the application.
module.exports = polyfill;
```

The given Node.js code is setting up a module that uses a polyfill mechanism. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. It requires necessary modules: `define-properties` (which is used to define properties with specific descriptor configurations on objects), `call-bind` (presumably used to bind functions to a context), `./implementation`, `./polyfill`, and `./shim` (which are custom module files that provide specific implementations, a polyfill, and a shim respectively).
   
2. It creates a `polyfill` function by binding it to `Object` using the `callBind` function and the `getPolyfill()` method. This suggests that `getPolyfill` may return a function that is intended to be used in the context of `Object`.

3. It then defines additional properties on the `polyfill` function using `define`. The properties added are `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`, each of which is set to the corresponding module.

4. Finally, this `polyfill` object, now enriched with additional properties, is exported as the module's public API.

The purpose of this module seems to be about providing a polyfill function that can also expose its implementation details and a shim, likely for compatibility purposes with older environments.

```javascript
'use strict';

const define = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

define(polyfill, {
	getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
	implementation: implementation,
	shim: shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that uses CommonJS syntax to export a function with additional properties added to it. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Importing Dependencies:**
   - It imports several modules using `require()`: `define-properties`, `call-bind`, `./implementation`, `./polyfill`, and `./shim`.

2. **Using `callBind`:**
   - It uses the `callBind` function with the result of `getPolyfill()` and `Object` as arguments. This likely binds a function to the `Object` context.

3. **Defining Additional Properties:**
   - It uses `define()` from `define-properties` to add three properties to the `polyfill` function: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`, each referencing the corresponding module.

4. **Exporting the Module:**
   - Finally, it exports the `polyfill` function, now enhanced with additional properties.

This module aims to provide a polyfill function that can be used with some additional helper methods attached to it, enabling easy access to its polyfill, implementation, and shim functionalities.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

defineProperties(polyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

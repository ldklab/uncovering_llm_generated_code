The original Node.js code is a module that imports a default export from a local module named `Graphemer`. This is done using a helper function `__importDefault` to ensure compatibility with both ES modules and CommonJS modules. The imported module is assigned to `Graphemer_1`, and then it re-exports the default export as the default export of the current module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the default export from the Graphemer module
import Graphemer from './Graphemer';

// Export the imported module as the default export of the current module
export default Graphemer;
```

The Node.js code provided is part of the 'istanbul-lib-coverage' library, which provides functionality to handle code coverage data. The module exports three primary methods to create and manage code coverage objects: `createCoverageSummary`, `createCoverageMap`, and `createFileCoverage`. These methods facilitate the instantiation of `CoverageSummary`, `CoverageMap`, and `FileCoverage` objects, respectively. The module also exports these classes for direct reuse.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const { FileCoverage } = require('./lib/file-coverage');
const { CoverageMap } = require('./lib/coverage-map');
const { CoverageSummary } = require('./lib/coverage-summary');

const createCoverageSummary = (obj) => {
    return obj instanceof CoverageSummary ? obj : new CoverageSummary(obj);
};

const createCoverageMap = (obj) => {
    return obj instanceof CoverageMap ? obj : new CoverageMap(obj);
};

const createFileCoverage = (obj) => {
    return obj instanceof FileCoverage ? obj : new FileCoverage(obj);
};

module.exports = {
    createCoverageSummary,
    createCoverageMap,
    createFileCoverage,
    classes: {
        FileCoverage
    }
};
```

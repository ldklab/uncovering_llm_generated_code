The original Node.js code is exporting both the default export and named exports from the `axios` module. It imports `axios` from a local module './lib/axios.js', and then it destructures various properties and methods from the `axios` object. Finally, it exports these destructured properties along with `axios` as the default export. This setup ensures that the module works consistently with both ES modules and CommonJS formats.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
import axios from './lib/axios.js';

// Destructure properties and methods from the axios object
const {
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
} = axios;

// Export axios as the default and all destructured properties as named exports
export {
  axios as default, // Default export
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
};
```

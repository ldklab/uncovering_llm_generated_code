The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to import the default export from a module located at './lib/axios.js' and re-export it along with its named exports. This allows the module to be used with both CommonJS and ES Module syntax while preserving compatibility with any existing static properties and methods on the default export. By extracting these properties, they are made available for import in other parts of the application. 

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
import axios from './lib/axios.js';

// Destructure the named exports from axios to make them available for individual imports
const {
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
} = axios;

// Export default and named interfaces for external use
export {
  axios as default, // Export axios as default
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
};
```

The provided Node.js code imports the default Axios module from a local file './lib/axios.js'. The script then deconstructs various components and functionalities from this default import and assigns them to corresponding named exports. The purpose is to expose all the necessary functionalities both as a default and as named exports, ensuring compatibility with both ECMAScript and CommonJS module systems.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
import axiosLib from './lib/axios.js';

// Destructure the functionalities from the imported default Axios module
const {
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
} = axiosLib;

// Export both the default Axios module and its functionalities as named exports
export {
  axiosLib as default,
  Axios,
  AxiosError,
  CanceledError,
  isCancel,
  CancelToken,
  VERSION,
  all,
  Cancel,
  isAxiosError,
  spread,
  toFormData,
  AxiosHeaders,
  HttpStatusCode,
  formToJSON,
  getAdapter,
  mergeConfig
};
```

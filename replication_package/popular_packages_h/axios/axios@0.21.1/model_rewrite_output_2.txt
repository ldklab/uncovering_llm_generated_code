The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export a module located in the `'./lib/axios'` path so that it can be used by other files or modules within a Node.js project. By using `module.exports`, the code is making whatever is exported from the `'./lib/axios'` file available to other parts of the application that require this module. Essentially, it's providing a way to import and use the Axios library from a custom directory structure.

Below is a possible rewrite for this Node.js code encapsulated within a single markdown code block:

```javascript
const axios = require('./lib/axios');

module.exports = axios;
```

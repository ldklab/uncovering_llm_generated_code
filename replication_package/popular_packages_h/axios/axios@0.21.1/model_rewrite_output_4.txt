The given Node.js code exports the module found in the './lib/axios' path. This means that whenever the file containing this line is imported elsewhere in a Node.js application using `require`, what will actually be imported is the module exported from './lib/axios'. This pattern is commonly used to create a single point of entry for libraries or modules, allowing them to be easily imported and used in other parts of an application. 

Here's a possible rewrite:

```javascript
const axios = require('./lib/axios');

module.exports = axios;
```

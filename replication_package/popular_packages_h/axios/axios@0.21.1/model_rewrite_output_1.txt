The original Node.js code is a simple module export statement that imports the 'axios' library from a local 'lib' directory and then exports it, making it available to other parts of the application that require this module. This setup allows you to encapsulate the import of the 'axios' library into a single file, potentially to manage multiple configurations or setups before exporting it as a module. This way, whenever you need to use `axios` in other parts of the project, you can import it via this module.

Here is a rewritten version of the same functionality:

```javascript
// Import the 'axios' library from the local 'lib' directory
const axios = require('./lib/axios');

// Export the axios library as a module for use in other parts of the application
module.exports = axios;
```

The given Node.js code is a straightforward module export statement. It exports whatever is returned by requiring the './lib/axios' module. This means that when another module imports the current module, it will effectively receive whatever is exported by the './lib/axios' module. The './lib/axios' is likely a file path that points to a file named 'axios' within a directory named 'lib'. The './lib/axios' file would contain its own module.exports statement(s) defining what is exported, be it a function, object, class, etc.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
// Export the module from './lib/axios'
const axios = require('./lib/axios');

module.exports = axios;
```

The Node.js code provided is a module for exporting the main functionalities of the `mongoose` library from a custom local implementation. It re-exports all the primary methods and properties available in the `mongoose` module, essentially creating a wrapper that exposes these functionalities. Additionally, this module facilitates compatibility with ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by re-exporting methods and properties that are specifically mentioned for use with ESM.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the mongoose library from the local `lib` directory
const mongoose = require('./lib/');

// Export the mongoose object, making all its methods and properties available as both named exports and default exports
module.exports = {
  ...mongoose,
  default: mongoose,
  mongoose: mongoose,
  
  // Re-export specific properties for ESM compatibility

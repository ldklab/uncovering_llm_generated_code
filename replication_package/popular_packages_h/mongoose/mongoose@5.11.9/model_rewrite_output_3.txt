The given Node.js code is a simple module that exports the contents of another module located in the `./lib/` directory. It uses the CommonJS module system to export whatever is defined in the `'./lib/'` module. This implies that the `./lib/` directory contains an `index.js` file or equivalent entry point that is being required and subsequently exported for use in other files.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code with the equivalent functionality:

```javascript
// Export the module located in the `lib` directory

'use strict';

// Path to the library module to be exported
const libPath = './lib/';

// Require and export the module found at the specified path
module.exports = require(libPath);
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module export component. It exports content from a file or directory located at `./lib/`, which is presumably the main entry file of the `mongoose` library in the codebase. By using `require('./lib/')`, it imports whatever is defined in the `index.js` file of the `lib` directory (or another file if explicitly specified within the directory), and then immediately exports it with `module.exports` so it can be used elsewhere in the application.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const mongooseLib = require('./lib/');

module.exports = mongooseLib;
```

This rewritten version does essentially the same thing—importing and exporting the main component of `mongoose` located in `./lib/`—but adds an intermediate variable `mongooseLib` for clarity.

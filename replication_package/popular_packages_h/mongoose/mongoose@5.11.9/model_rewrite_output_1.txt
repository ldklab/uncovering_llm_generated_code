The Node.js code provided is a simple module export statement. It uses `require` to import a module or set of functionalities from the relative path `./lib/` and exports it. This allows other files to use the exported module by requiring this file. The exported module is presumably a Mongoose library or a configuration setup residing in the `lib` directory.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Exporting the contents of the lib directory
'use strict';

// Requires the module from the lib directory and exports it
module.exports = require('./lib/');
```

The provided Node.js code is a simple module that exports the main functionality of another module located in the './lib/' directory. The `require` function is used to import that module, and then it is exported using `module.exports`, making it available for other files to import and use. The code is set up to ensure that the exports are using strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// Using strict mode for better error handling and to prevent certain actions
'use strict';

// Import and export the module from the './lib/' directory
const libMongoose = require('./lib/');

module.exports = libMongoose;
```

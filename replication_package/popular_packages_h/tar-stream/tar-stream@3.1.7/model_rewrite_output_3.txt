The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to export two modules, `extract` and `pack`. These modules are likely located in the same directory as this file and are required by using the `require` function. The `exports` object is used to make these modules available for other parts of the application to import and use.

Hereâ€™s the rewritten code:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

The provided Node.js code is an example of module exportation. It exports two modules, `extract` and `pack`, from separate files. This allows these modules to be imported and used in other parts of the application. The `require('./extract')` and `require('./pack')` lines are importing the `extract` and `pack` modules from their respective files located in the same directory. These modules are then added to the `exports` object, making them accessible when this module is imported elsewhere.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack,
};
```

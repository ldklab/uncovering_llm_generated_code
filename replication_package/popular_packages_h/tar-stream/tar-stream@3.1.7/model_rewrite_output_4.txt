The provided Node.js code is exporting two modules, `extract` and `pack`, from the current directory. These modules are required using the `require()` function, which loads the modules from their respective files, and they are accessible for import in other parts of the application using the `exports` object.

Here is a possible rewrite:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export two modules, `extract` and `pack`, from the current module. These modules are required from the file paths `./extract` and `./pack`, respectively. This code is making functions or other exports from these two files accessible when this module is imported elsewhere.

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack,
};
```

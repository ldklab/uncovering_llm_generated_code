The original Node.js code exports two modules: `extract` and `pack`. These modules are presumably located in the same directory as the current file, and they are imported using the `require` function. The modules are then exported so that they can be used in other parts of the application. Below is a possible rewrite of this code in a different structure.

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

The provided Node.js code is exporting two modules, `extract` and `pack`, from separate files named `extract.js` and `pack.js` (these files are located in the same directory as the current file). This is done using `require`, which is a built-in function in Node.js for including modules. Each module is likely a separate JavaScript file that contains functionality related to "extracting" and "packing". These functionalities are then made available for use in other parts of the application by exporting them from this module. 

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

The Node.js code is an export statement that allows functionalities from two different modules, `extract` and `pack`, to be made available for use in other parts of the application. These modules are being required from their respective files relative to the current file (`./extract` and `./pack`).

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

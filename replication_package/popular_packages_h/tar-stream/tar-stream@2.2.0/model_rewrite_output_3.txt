The given Node.js code exports two modules, `extract` and `pack`, making them accessible from other files that require this module. The `extract` module is being imported from a file named `extract.js` located in the same directory, and similarly, the `pack` module is imported from a file named `pack.js`.

Here's a possible rewrite for the code:

```javascript
const extract = require('./extract');
const pack = require('./pack');

module.exports = {
  extract,
  pack
};
```

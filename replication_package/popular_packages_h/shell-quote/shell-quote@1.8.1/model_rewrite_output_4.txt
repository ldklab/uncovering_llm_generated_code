The given Node.js code snippet is exporting two modules, `quote` and `parse`, which are presumably from separate files named `quote.js` and `parse.js` located in the same directory. By using `require('./quote')` and `require('./parse')`, these modules are being made available to other files that import this module. The use of `exports` allows other files to access the functionality or objects defined in `quote` and `parse`.

Below is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const quote = require('./quote');
const parse = require('./parse');

module.exports = {
  quote,
  parse,
};
```

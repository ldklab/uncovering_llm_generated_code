The provided Node.js code is a CommonJS module (`require` and `exports` are specific to CommonJS) that exports two functionalities: `quote` and `parse`. It imports these functionalities from the files named `quote.js` and `parse.js`, respectively, which must be located in the same directory as this module. Once imported, these functionalities are then exported as properties of the `exports` object, making them accessible to any other module that imports this one.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const quote = require('./quote');
const parse = require('./parse');

module.exports = {
    quote,
    parse
};
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module that exports two functionalities: `quote` and `parse`. These functionalities are required from two separate files named `quote.js` and `parse.js`, which are expected to be located in the same directory as this module. The module uses CommonJS syntax to export these functionalities, making them available for import in other files.

A possible rewrite using ES6 module syntax could look like the following:

```javascript
import quote from './quote';
import parse from './parse';

export { quote, parse };
```

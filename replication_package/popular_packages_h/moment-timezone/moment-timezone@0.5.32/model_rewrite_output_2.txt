The provided Node.js code is a configuration setup for the `moment-timezone` library, which is used for working with dates and times in various time zones. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It requires the `moment-timezone` module, a library that builds on top of `moment.js` to add timezone functionality.
2. It assigns `moment-timezone` to both `moment` and `module.exports`, making it available for other modules that require this file.
3. It loads timezone data from a JSON file (`latest.json`), which presumably contains the latest timezone information, using the `moment.tz.load()` method.

Based on this explanation, here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import the 'moment-timezone' library which is based on 'moment'
const moment = require("./moment-timezone");

// Load the latest timezone data from the specified JSON file
moment.tz.load(require('./data/packed/latest.json'));

// Export the configured 'moment' object for use in other parts of the application
module.exports = moment;
```

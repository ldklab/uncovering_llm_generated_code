The given Node.js code performs the following actions:

1. Imports the `moment-timezone` library by requiring a local module file named `moment-timezone`. This library is an extension of the `moment` library that adds support for parsing and displaying dates in any time zone.

2. The `moment` variable is assigned as a part of `module.exports`, making it available for other files that require it.

3. It loads timezone data from a JSON file named `latest.json` located within a `data/packed` directory. This JSON file contains pre-packed timezone data, which is used by the `moment-timezone` library to convert and manipulate time zone information.

Rewritten code:

```javascript
// Import the moment-timezone module for extended date functionalities with timezone support
const momentTimezone = require("./moment-timezone");

// Load the most recent timezone data into moment-timezone
momentTimezone.tz.load(require('./data/packed/latest.json'));

// Export the configured momentTimezone for use in other modules
module.exports = momentTimezone;
```

The provided Node.js code is performing the following functions:

1. It imports the `moment-timezone` module and assigns it to the variable `moment`. It also exports this module so it can be used by other parts of the application through `module.exports`.
2. It loads timezone data from a JSON file located in the `./data/packed/` directory. The file `latest.json` contains the packed timezone data needed for `moment-timezone` to function correctly with time zones.

The code is essentially preparing the `moment-timezone` library to handle time zones by loading the necessary data from the `latest.json` file.

Here is a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
const moment = require("./moment-timezone");
const timezoneData = require('./data/packed/latest.json');

moment.tz.load(timezoneData);

module.exports = moment;
```

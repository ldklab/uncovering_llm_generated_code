The given Node.js code is used to load the 'moment-timezone' module and extend it with timezone data. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `var moment = module.exports = require("./moment-timezone");`: This line loads the 'moment-timezone' module by requiring it from a file named `moment-timezone.js`, or from the node_modules directory if it's installed there. The `module.exports` syntax exports `moment` so it can be used in other files that require this module.

2. `moment.tz.load(require('./data/packed/latest.json'));`: This line loads timezone data from a JSON file located at `./data/packed/latest.json` and uses the `load()` method of the `moment.tz` (timezone) object to populate the moment-timezone instance with this data. This allows the moment-timezone library to accurately process and manipulate timezone information based on the latest available data.

By organizing these steps, the code facilitates the extension of the core functionality of the moment library with timezone support, enabling applications to handle date and time operations across different time zones.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const moment = require("./moment-timezone");

// Load timezone data into the moment-timezone library
moment.tz.load(require('./data/packed/latest.json'));

// Export the configured moment for use in other modules
module.exports = moment;
```

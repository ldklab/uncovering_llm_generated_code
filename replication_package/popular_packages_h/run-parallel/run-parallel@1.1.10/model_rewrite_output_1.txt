The functionality of the provided Node.js code, `runParallel`, is to execute multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel. It accepts two parameters: `tasks` and a callback `cb`. The `tasks` can be either an array or an object where each element or property contains a task function. These task functions are expected to execute asynchronously and accept a callback that they invoke once they have completed, passing any potential errors and results to this callback.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. It initializes variables `results` to store the results of the tasks, `pending` to keep track of the number of tasks still pending completion, and `keys` if the tasks are provided as an object to keep track of the object keys.

2. It checks if the provided tasks is an array or an object and initializes the `results` and `pending` variables accordingly.

3. A `done` function is defined that calls the provided `cb` callback with any error and the results once all tasks are complete, using `process.nextTick` if the execution was synchronous initially.

4. An `each` function is defined to handle the completion of each task. It stores the result of the task, reduces the `pending` count, and calls `done` if an error occurs or all tasks finish.

5. The tasks are processed depending on whether they are an array or an object. The tasks are executed, and their completion is handled via the `each` function. 

6. `isSync` ensures the proper handling of synchronous execution by delaying the `done` callback until the next event loop tick if initial execution was synchronous.

Here's a possible rewrite for this Node.js code:

```javascript
module.exports = runParallel;

function runParallel(tasks, callback) {
  let results, pending, keys;
  let isSync = true;

  if (Array.isArray(tasks)) {
    results = [];
    pending = tasks.length;
  } else {
    keys = Object.keys(tasks);
    results = {};
    pending = keys.length;
  }

  if (!pending) {
    process.nextTick(() => callback(null, results));
    return;
  }

  const done = (error) => {
    const complete = () => {
      if (callback) callback(error, results);
      callback = null;
    };
    if (isSync) process.nextTick(complete);
    else complete();
  };

  const handleResult = (index, error, result) => {
    results[index] = result;
    if (--pending === 0 || error) {
      done(error);
    }
  };

  if (keys) {
    keys.forEach((key) => {
      tasks[key]((error, result) => handleResult(key, error, result));
    });
  } else {
    tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
      task((error, result) => handleResult(index, error, result));
    });
  }

  isSync = false;
}
```

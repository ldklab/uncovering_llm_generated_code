The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function named `runParallel`. This function is designed to execute multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel and collects the results into an array or object, depending on the input type. 

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The `runParallel` function takes two arguments: `tasks` and a callback `cb`.
2. `tasks` can be either an array of functions or an object with functions as values. Each function in the tasks list must accept a callback, which should be invoked upon completion with an error and a result value.
3. The function determines whether `tasks` is an array or an object. It initializes `results` based on the type and sets up a `pending` counter to track how many tasks have yet to complete.
4. A `done` function is defined to execute the callback `cb` with the final results once all tasks have finished or upon encountering an error.
5. An `each` function handles the result of each task, storing the result in `results` and decrementing the `pending` counter. It calls `done` either when all tasks have completed or an error is encountered.
6. If `tasks` is empty, the `done` function is called immediately.
7. If `tasks` is an object, it iterates through the keys and executes each task function. If it's an array, it iterates through the list and does the same.
8. The `isSync` flag is used to decide if the completion callback should be scheduled using `queueMicrotask` to prevent potential synchronous execution issues.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
module.exports = runParallel;

const queueMicrotask = require('queue-microtask');

function runParallel(tasks, cb) {
  let results, pending, keys;
  let isSync = true;

  if (Array.isArray(tasks)) {
    results = [];
    pending = tasks.length;
  } else {
    keys = Object.keys(tasks);
    results = {};
    pending = keys.length;
  }

  function done(err) {
    const finish = () => {
      if (cb) cb(err, results);
      cb = null;
    };
    if (isSync) queueMicrotask(finish);
    else finish();
  }

  function each(i, err, result) {
    results[i] = result;
    if (--pending === 0 || err) {
      done(err);
    }
  }

  if (!pending) {
    done(null);
  } else if (keys) {
    keys.forEach(key => {
      tasks[key]((err, result) => each(key, err, result));
    });
  } else {
    tasks.forEach((task, i) => {
      task((err, result) => each(i, err, result));
    });
  }

  isSync = false;
}
```

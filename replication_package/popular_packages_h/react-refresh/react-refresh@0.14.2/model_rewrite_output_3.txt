The given Node.js code is designed to conditionally export different modules based on the environment in which the Node.js application is running. Specifically, it uses the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is in a 'production' or 'development' setting.

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', the application exports a minified production version of the `react-refresh-runtime` module (suitable for production environments to enhance performance and reduce file size).
- Otherwise (typically in a development setting), it exports a development version of the `react-refresh-runtime` module, which likely includes additional debugging information to help developers during development.

Below is the rewritten code following the explained logic:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction
  ? './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js'
  : './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

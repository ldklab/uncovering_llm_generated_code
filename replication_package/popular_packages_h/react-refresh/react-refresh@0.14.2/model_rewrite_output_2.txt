The given Node.js code is a module export script that conditionally exports different modules based on the environment in which the application is running. The `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable is typically set to either 'production' or 'development', indicating the current mode. If the environment is 'production', the code exports a minified version of the 'react-refresh-runtime' library optimized for production use. If it's not 'production' but rather 'development' (or any other unspecified environment), it exports a non-minified version suitable for development with more verbose logging and debugging information.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const productionModule = './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js';
const developmentModule = './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

const config = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? productionModule : developmentModule;

module.exports = require(config);
```

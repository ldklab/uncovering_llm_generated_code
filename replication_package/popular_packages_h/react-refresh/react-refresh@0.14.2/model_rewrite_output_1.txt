The given Node.js code is a module export logic that dynamically determines which version of a module to export based on the current environment. It checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to 'production'. 

- If the environment is 'production', it exports a minified, production-ready version of the `react-refresh-runtime` module (`react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js`) located in the `cjs` directory.
- If the environment is not set to 'production', it exports the development version of the same module (`react-refresh-runtime.development.js`), which may include additional debugging information and tools suitable for development.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = environment === 'production';
const path = './cjs/';

const productionModule = 'react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js';
const developmentModule = 'react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

const modulePath = isProduction ? path + productionModule : path + developmentModule;

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

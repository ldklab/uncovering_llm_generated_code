The Node.js code provided is a conditional export strategy based on the environment in which the application is running. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine if the application is running in a production environment. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports a minified production version of the `react-refresh-runtime` library. Otherwise, it exports a development version of the same library, which likely includes additional debugging information or features helpful during development.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const libraryPath = isProduction ? './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js' : './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

module.exports = require(libraryPath);
```

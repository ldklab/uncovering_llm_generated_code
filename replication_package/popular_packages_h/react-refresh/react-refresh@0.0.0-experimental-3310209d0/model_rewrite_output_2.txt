The given Node.js code is a conditional module export based on the environment in which the Node.js application is running. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a 'production' or 'development' environment. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', the code exports a minified version of a module (`react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js`). If it is not set to 'production', it assumes the environment is for development and exports an unminified version of the module (`react-refresh-runtime.development.js`).

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const productionPath = './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js';
const developmentPath = './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

module.exports = isProduction ? require(productionPath) : require(developmentPath);
```

The provided Node.js code dynamically exports different versions of a module based on the environment setting. The environment is determined by the `NODE_ENV` variable:

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the minified production version of the `react-refresh-runtime` module.
- Otherwise (e.g., when in development), it exports the development version of the `react-refresh-runtime` module.

This allows for optimized performance and smaller bundle sizes in production, while maintaining more debug capabilities during development.

Here is a possible rewrite of this functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction 
  ? './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.production.min.js' 
  : './cjs/react-refresh-runtime.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports three functionalities: `formats`, `parse`, and `stringify`. Each of these functionalities is required from their respective files within the same directory. The module bundle essentially consolidates these three functionalities into a single module, allowing other parts of an application to import and use them.

Here is a possible rewrite of the provided code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const stringify = require('./stringify');
const parse = require('./parse');
const formats = require('./formats');

module.exports = {
    formats,
    parse,
    stringify
};
```

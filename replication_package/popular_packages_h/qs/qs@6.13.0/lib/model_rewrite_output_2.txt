The provided Node.js code is creating a module that exports three functionalities: `formats`, `parse`, and `stringify`. It achieves this by first requiring these three modules from their respective files (`./formats`, `./parse`, and `./stringify`) and then exporting them as properties of the `module.exports` object. This allows other parts of the application or other applications to import and use these functionalities by including this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const stringify = require('./stringify');
const parse = require('./parse');
const formats = require('./formats');

module.exports = {
    formats,
    parse,
    stringify
};
```

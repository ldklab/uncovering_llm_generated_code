The Node.js code provided is a module that exports three functionalities. It imports three modules: `stringify`, `parse`, and `formats` from respective files located in the same directory. These modules are then re-exported as properties of an object. This allows other files to import these functionalities collectively from a single module.

Below is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const stringify = require('./stringify');
const parse = require('./parse');
const formats = require('./formats');

module.exports = {
    formats,
    parse,
    stringify
};
```

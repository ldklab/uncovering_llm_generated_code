The function of the provided Node.js code is to conditionally export a module based on the environment in which the application is running. The code checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports a minified production version of the module located at `./cjs/scheduler.production.min.js`.
- Otherwise, it exports a development version of the module located at `./cjs/scheduler.development.js`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the above Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const schedulerModule = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? './cjs/scheduler.production.min.js' 
  : './cjs/scheduler.development.js';

module.exports = require(schedulerModule);
```

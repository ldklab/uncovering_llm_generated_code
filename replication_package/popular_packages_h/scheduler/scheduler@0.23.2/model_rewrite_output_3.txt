The provided Node.js code is a module export script that determines which version of a module to export based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. In Node.js applications, `NODE_ENV` is commonly used to specify the environment the application is running in, such as 'development', 'production', 'test', etc. This script checks if the current environment is 'production'. If it is, it exports the production version of the `scheduler` module, typically optimized and minified for production use to enhance performance and reduce file size. Otherwise, if the environment is not 'production', it exports the development version, which usually includes extra features useful during development, such as detailed error messages or debugging tools.

Here is a possible rewrite of the provided Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const schedulerPath = isProduction 
  ? './cjs/scheduler.production.min.js' 
  : './cjs/scheduler.development.js';

module.exports = require(schedulerPath);
```

The Node.js code provided is an environment-based module export script. It checks the current environment that the application is running in by evaluating the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. 

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the module found at `'./cjs/scheduler.production.min.js'`, which is likely a minified and optimized version of a library meant for production deployments.
- Otherwise, it exports the module located at `'./cjs/scheduler.development.js'`, which is probably a more verbose version, possibly including additional debugging information, suitable for development purposes.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction ? './cjs/scheduler.production.min.js' : './cjs/scheduler.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

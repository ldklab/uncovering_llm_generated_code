The Node.js code is a conditional module exporter that checks the environment in which the application is running. It exports different versions of a module based on whether the application is running in a production or development environment. 

- If the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the minified production version of the scheduler module located at `'./cjs/scheduler.production.min.js'`.
- Otherwise, it exports the development version of the scheduler module located at `'./cjs/scheduler.development.js'`.

Here's a rewritten version of the functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction ? './cjs/scheduler.production.min.js' : './cjs/scheduler.development.js';
module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

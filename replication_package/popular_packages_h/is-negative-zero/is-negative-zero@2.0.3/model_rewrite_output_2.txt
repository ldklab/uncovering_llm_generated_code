The functionality of the given Node.js code is to determine whether a given number is negative zero. In JavaScript, the number 0 can have two forms: positive zero (`0`) and negative zero (`-0`). While they are equal in value (`0 === -0`), they can be differentiated using division. Dividing by positive zero results in positive infinity (`Infinity`), while dividing by negative zero results in negative infinity (`-Infinity`). This function uses this property to check if a given number is negative zero.

Below is a rewritten version of the provided Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

/**
 * Checks if the given number is negative zero.
 *
 * @param {number} number - The number to check.
 * @returns {boolean} True if the number is negative zero, otherwise false.
 */
function isNegativeZero(number) {
    return number === 0 && (1 / number) === -Infinity;
}

module.exports = isNegativeZero;
```

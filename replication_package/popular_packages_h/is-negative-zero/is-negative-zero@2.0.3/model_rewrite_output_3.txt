The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to define and export a function named `isNegativeZero`, which takes a number as its argument and determines if it is negative zero (`-0`). In JavaScript, although -0 and +0 are conceptually the same, they can be distinguished through other operations. The function specifically checks if the number is equal to zero and its reciprocal (`1/number`) results in negative infinity (`-Infinity`), a condition that only applies to negative zero.

Here is the rewritten code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Function to check if a given number is negative zero
module.exports = function isNegativeZero(number) {
    // Check if the number is zero and its reciprocal evaluates to negative infinity
    return number === 0 && (1 / number) === -Infinity;
};
```

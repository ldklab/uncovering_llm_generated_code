The provided Node.js code defines a function `isNegativeZero` that checks if a given number is negative zero. In JavaScript, negative zero (`-0`) is a distinct value from positive zero (`0`). The function works by first verifying if the `number` is equal to zero (`number === 0`), then it checks if the reciprocal of this number results in negative infinity (`(1 / number) === -Infinity`). This second check effectively distinguishes negative zero from positive zero, as dividing by negative zero results in negative infinity, whereas dividing by positive zero results in positive infinity.

Here's a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

function isNegativeZero(number) {
    if (number !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return (1 / number) === -Infinity;
}

module.exports = isNegativeZero;
```

The functionality of the Node.js code provided is to create and export a module named `isNegativeZero`. This module is essentially a function that checks whether a given number is negative zero. 

In JavaScript, both `+0` and `-0` are considered equal to `0`. However, they can be differentiated by their behavior in division. Dividing `1` by `-0` yields `-Infinity`, while dividing `1` by `+0` yields `Infinity`. This function leverages this characteristic to determine if the input number is negative zero.

The function performs the following checks:
1. It first checks if the number is strictly equal to `0`.
2. It then checks if dividing `1` by the number results in `-Infinity`.

If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`, indicating that the number is indeed negative zero. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

function isNegativeZero(number) {
  if (number === 0) {
    const result = 1 / number;
    return result === -Infinity;
  }
  return false;
}

module.exports = isNegativeZero;
```

The provided Node.js code is designed to manage a global Promise object and a separate implementation known as "bluebird". Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code starts by storing the existing global Promise object (if it exists) in a variable called `old`.
2. It defines a `noConflict` function that attempts to restore the global Promise object:
   - It checks if the current global Promise object is the same as the bluebird promise implementation, and if so, reverts it back to the previously stored `old` Promise.
   - If an error occurs during this process, it silently catches it.
   - The function returns the bluebird promise implementation regardless of whether the global Promise is changed.
3. The bluebird promise implementation is required via a module "./promise" and stored in the variable `bluebird`.
4. The `noConflict` function is assigned as a property of the `bluebird` object, allowing users to call `bluebird.noConflict()` if they want to revert the global Promise to its original implementation.
5. Finally, the `bluebird` object (with its additional `noConflict` method) is exported as a module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

let originalPromise;

if (typeof Promise !== "undefined") {
    originalPromise = Promise;
}

function restoreOriginalPromise() {
    try {
        if (Promise === bluebirdPromise) {
            Promise = originalPromise;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Ignore errors that arise during Promise reassignment
    }
    return bluebirdPromise;
}

const bluebirdPromise = require("./promise")();
bluebirdPromise.noConflict = restoreOriginalPromise;

module.exports = bluebirdPromise;
```

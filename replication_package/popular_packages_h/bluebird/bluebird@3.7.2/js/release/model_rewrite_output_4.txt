The Node.js code provided is a module that deals with managing conflicts between the native Promise implementation and a custom promise library, in this case, `bluebird`. The `noConflict` function is used to restore the original `Promise` object if `Promise` has been overwritten by `bluebird`. Here's how the code works:

1. It checks if `Promise` is already defined in the environment and saves the original `Promise` implementation in a variable `old`.
2. It defines a `noConflict` function which tries to restore the reference of `Promise` back to the original one by comparing if the global `Promise` object points to the `bluebird` implementation.
3. It loads a customizable version of `bluebird` from a relative file path.
4. The `noConflict` function is attached to the `bluebird` object to allow it to restore the native `Promise` upon calling.
5. Finally, it exports the `bluebird` module for use in other parts of the application.

Below is a rewritten version of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

let originalPromise;

if (typeof Promise !== "undefined") {
    originalPromise = Promise;
}

function restoreNativePromise() {
    try {
        if (Promise === bluebirdPromise) {
            Promise = originalPromise;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle the error if any occurs during reassignment.
    }
    return bluebirdPromise;
}

const bluebirdPromise = require("./promise")();

bluebirdPromise.noConflict = restoreNativePromise;

module.exports = bluebirdPromise;
```

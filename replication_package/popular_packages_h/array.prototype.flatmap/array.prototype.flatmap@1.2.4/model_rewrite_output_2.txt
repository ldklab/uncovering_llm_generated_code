The provided Node.js code is setting up a module that exports a "flatMap" functionality, possibly for arrays or similar iterable objects. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Dependencies and Modules**: 
   - It imports several dependencies: `define-properties`, `call-bind`, and three modules from the same directory: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`.

2. **Polyfill**: 
   - The `getPolyfill` function is used to retrieve a polyfill, which is presumably a fallback implementation of the `flatMap` method that provides compatibility for environments that don’t support it natively.

3. **Call Bind**: 
   - `callBind` is used to create a version of `flatMap` that is bound to its polyfill implementation. This means the polyfill can be used as if it were a method on the objects it applies to.

4. **Define Properties**: 
   - The `define` method from `define-properties` is used to attach additional properties to the `boundFlatMap` function. These properties are references to the `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` modules.

5. **Export**:
   - The `boundFlatMap` function, now with extra properties, is exported as the module’s output. This provides a `flatMap` function with additional methods and information.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = getPolyfill();
const boundFlatMap = callBind(polyfill);

defineProperties(boundFlatMap, {
	getPolyfill,
	implementation,
	shim
});

module.exports = boundFlatMap;
```

The current Node.js code is a module that provides a polyfill for a method using several utility modules. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Dependencies**: The code imports several modules including `define-properties`, `call-bind`, an `implementation` of a method, a function to get a `polyfill`, and a `shim`.

2. **Polyfill Initialization**: The code calls `getPolyfill` to initialize a polyfill method that supplements or replaces functionality in environments where it's missing or incomplete.

3. **Function Binding**: `callBind` is used to bind the polyfill function, creating a function `boundFlatMap` that is effectively tied to the behavior provided by `polyfill`.

4. **Property Definition**: Additional properties are defined on `boundFlatMap` using `define-properties`. These properties include:
   - `getPolyfill`: A reference to the polyfill getter function.
   - `implementation`: A direct reference to the implementation logic.
   - `shim`: A function that ensures the polyfill is properly applied.

5. **Export**: The `boundFlatMap` function, now augmented with additional properties, is exported as the module's main export.

Here's the rewritten code based on this explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const define = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const polyfill = getPolyfill();
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundFlatMap = callBind(polyfill);

define(boundFlatMap, {
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    implementation: implementation,
    shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundFlatMap;
```

The Node.js code provided is used to conditionally export the appropriate version of the Immer library, which is a library for creating copies of JavaScript objects with modified data. The specific version loaded depends on the environment in which the Node.js application is running.

- If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'production'`, it exports the minified and optimized production version of Immer (`./immer.cjs.production.min.js`).
- Otherwise, it exports the development version of Immer (`./immer.cjs.development.js`), which typically includes more debugging information and checks.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const immerModule = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? './immer.cjs.production.min.js'
  : './immer.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(immerModule);
```

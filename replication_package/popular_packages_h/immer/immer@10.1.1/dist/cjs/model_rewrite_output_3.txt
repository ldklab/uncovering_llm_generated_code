The provided Node.js code is a conditional export pattern commonly used to load different module versions based on the environment. It checks the application's environment variable `NODE_ENV` to determine if the application is running in production mode. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports the module from 'immer.cjs.production.js', which is assumed to be a production-optimized version of the Immer library. Otherwise, it exports from 'immer.cjs.development.js', the development version, likely containing helpful debugging features or less performance optimizations.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const immerModule = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? './immer.cjs.production.js'
  : './immer.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(immerModule);
```

The Node.js code provided is a conditional module export pattern based on the environment in which the code is running. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a 'production' or a non-production environment (typically 'development'). Based on this, it exports either the production or development version of a module, presumably to optimize performance and error handling for the appropriate environment. 

In 'production', it exports 'immer.cjs.production.js', and in non-production environments, it exports 'immer.cjs.development.js'. This pattern is commonly used for bundling tools or libraries that offer different builds optimized for production and development considerations.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const modulePath = environment === 'production' 
  ? './immer.cjs.production.js' 
  : './immer.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

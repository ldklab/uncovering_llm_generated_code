The Node.js code is setting up conditional exports based on the environment in which the application is running. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

1. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', the code exports the module located at './immer.cjs.production.js'. This is typically a version of the module that is optimized for performance and smaller bundle size.
   
2. If `NODE_ENV` is not set to 'production', it defaults to exporting the module located at './immer.cjs.development.js'. This version usually includes additional logging, error messages, or debugging capabilities helpful during development.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const production = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = production ? './immer.cjs.production.js' : './immer.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

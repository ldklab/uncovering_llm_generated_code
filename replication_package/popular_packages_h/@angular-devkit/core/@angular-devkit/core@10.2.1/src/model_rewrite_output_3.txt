The given Node.js code is using CommonJS modules and provides functionality to bundle multiple modules and re-exports them. It starts by defining some utility functions (`__createBinding` and `__exportStar`) for creating bindings and exporting module properties. Then it imports specific modules like `analytics`, `experimental`, `json`, `logging`, `terminal`, and `workspaces`. It exports these modules so that they can be easily used in other parts of the application. Additionally, it re-exports everything from certain modules like `exception`, `json`, `utils`, and `virtual-fs`, making all their exports available for import from this module.

A significant note in the code is the deprecation warning associated with the `terminal` export—suggesting developers use third-party libraries like `colors` or `chalk` instead.

Here is the rewrittten code using modern JavaScript (ES6+):

```javascript
"use strict";

import * as analytics from './analytics';
import * as experimental from './experimental';
import * as json from './json/index';
import * as logging from './logger/index';
import * as ɵterminal from './terminal/index';
import * as workspaces from './workspace';
export * from './exception/exception';
export * from './json/index';
export * from './utils/index';
export * from './virtual-fs/index';

The Node.js code provided is designed to conditionally export a module based on the environment in which it is running. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Conditional `require` Implementation**: The code first checks if the `__webpack_require__` function is defined. This function is typically used within Webpack environments to handle module loading. If Webpack is being used, the code assigns `__non_webpack_require__` to `runtimeRequire`; otherwise, it falls back to the standard `require` function. This ensures compatibility with both Webpack and non-Webpack environments.

2. **Addon Resolution Support**: The next check determines if the `runtimeRequire.addon` method exists and is a function. This method, if available, suggests that the platform supports native module resolution natively.

3. **Module Export**: 
   - If `runtimeRequire.addon` is available, the code binds it to `runtimeRequire` and exports it. This means the addon resolution function is used directly, leveraging potential performance or compatibility benefits of the native support.
   - If `runtimeRequire.addon` is not available, it defaults to exporting a module from a local file `./node-gyp-build.js`. This file presumably contains logic to handle module loading at runtime using a `node-gyp` build, which is a tool used to compile native addon modules for Node.js.

Here's a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const determineRequire = () => {
  if (typeof __webpack_require__ === 'function') {
    return __non_webpack_require__;
  }
  return require;
};

const runtimeRequire = determineRequire();

if (typeof runtimeRequire.addon === 'function') {
  module.exports = runtimeRequire.addon.bind(runtimeRequire);
} else {
  module.exports = require('./node-gyp-build.js');
}
```

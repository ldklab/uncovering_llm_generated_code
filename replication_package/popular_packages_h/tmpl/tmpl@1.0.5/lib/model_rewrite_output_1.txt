The given Node.js code provides a simple template engine function that can interpolate data into a string using placeholders enclosed in curly braces (e.g., `{placeholder}`). Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. `INTERPOLATE` is a regular expression that identifies text within curly braces `{}`.
2. The function exported by `module.exports` takes a `str` (template string) and an optional `data` object.
3. Inside the function, a string `tmpl` is constructed that creates JavaScript code. 
4. `__p` is an array which accumulates parts of the string to be returned.
5. `print` is defined to push arguments into `__p`.
6. `with(obj||{})` is used to allow easy access to object properties within the template string.
7. `str` is modified:
   - Backslashes are escaped.
   - Single quotes are escaped.
   - Placeholders matched by `INTERPOLATE` are replaced with expressions that embed the result of evaluating the placeholder expressions using `eval`.
   - Carriage returns, newlines, and tabs are replaced with their escaped versions.
8. The modified template string is executed as a function using the `Function` constructor, which takes the `data` object as its argument.
9. If `data` is provided, the function is immediately invoked with `data`, otherwise, the function itself is returned for later use.

Here's a rewritten version of the provided Node.js code with similar functionality:

```javascript
const INTERPOLATE = /{([^{]+?)}/g;

module.exports = function(template, data) {
  const templateString =
    "const __p = []; const print = (...args) => { __p.push(...args); }; " +
    "with(obj || {}) { __p.push('" +
    template
      .replace(/\\/g, '\\\\')
      .replace(/'/g, "\\'")
      .replace(INTERPOLATE, (match, code) => "'," + code.replace(/\\'/g, "'") + ",'")
      .replace(/\r/g, '\\r')
      .replace(/\n/g, '\\n')
      .replace(/\t/g, '\\t') +
    "'); } return __p.join('');";

  const templateFunction = new Function('obj', templateString);

  return data ? templateFunction(data) : templateFunction;
}
```

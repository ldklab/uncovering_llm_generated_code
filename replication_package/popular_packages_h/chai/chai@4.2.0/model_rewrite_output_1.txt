The given Node.js code is a simple module export that imports a module from a file located at `'./lib/chai'` and immediately exports it. This line of code is essentially re-exporting the contents of the `'./lib/chai'` file so that when this module is required elsewhere, it returns whatever is exported from `'./lib/chai'`.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// Importing the module from './lib/chai'
const chai = require('./lib/chai');

// Exporting the imported module
module.exports = chai;
```

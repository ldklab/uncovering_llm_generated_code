The Node.js code provides a module export that is directly re-exporting the contents of another module located at `./lib/chai`. This means that when this module is required in another part of the application, it will actually load whatever the `./lib/chai` module exports. Essentially, it's acting as a passthrough or alias to the `./lib/chai` module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
// Export the contents of './lib/chai' directly as the module's export
const chaiModule = require('./lib/chai');
module.exports = chaiModule;
```

In this rewrite, we've added a variable `chaiModule` to store the result of `require('./lib/chai')`, and then exported that variable. The functionality remains unchanged.

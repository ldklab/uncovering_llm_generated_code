The original Node.js code exports a module located in the `'./lib/chai'` path. This means that whenever another file requires this particular module, what will be received is the contents or exports of the `'./lib/chai'` module. It is essentially creating a shortcut so that users of this module don't have to know the internal folder structure; they can simply require this module to get access to whatever `'./lib/chai'` provides.

Here's a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
const chai = require('./lib/chai');
module.exports = chai;
```

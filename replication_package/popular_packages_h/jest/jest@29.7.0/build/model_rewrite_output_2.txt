The functionality of this Node.js code is to create module exports that provide access to specific functions or objects from two external modules, `@jest/core` and `jest-cli`. It defines properties on the `exports` object with specific names ('SearchSource', 'createTestScheduler', 'getVersion', 'run', 'runCLI'), which are lazily loaded from the required modules. The `Object.defineProperty()` method is used to define properties that are enumerable and have getter functions. The getter functions use private functions `_core` and `_jestCli` to require and cache the module contents.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const core = require('@jest/core');
const jestCli = require('jest-cli');

exports.SearchSource = core.SearchSource;
exports.createTestScheduler = core.createTestScheduler;
exports.getVersion = core.getVersion;
exports.run = jestCli.run;
exports.runCLI = core.runCLI;
```

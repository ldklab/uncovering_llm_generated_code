The provided Node.js code defines and exports a function called `extend`. This function takes any number of objects as arguments and merges their properties into a new target object. The merging process involves iterating over each property of the provided source objects and copying provided properties to the target if they are owned directly by the source objects (and not inherited through the prototype chain). Finally, the function returns the target object containing the combined properties from all the source objects.

Here's a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
module.exports = extend;

function extend(...sources) {
    const target = {};

    sources.forEach(source => {
        Object.keys(source).forEach(key => {
            target[key] = source[key];
        });
    });

    return target;
}
```

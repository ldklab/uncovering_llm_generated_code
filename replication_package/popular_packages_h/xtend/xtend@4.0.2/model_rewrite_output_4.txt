The provided Node.js code defines a function `extend` that takes any number of objects as arguments and copies the properties from each of these source objects into a new target object. It only copies properties that these objects own directly, ignoring any inherited properties. The `extend` function merges these properties into the target object and returns this newly created object. This function essentially performs a shallow copy of all properties from the source objects into a single target object.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
module.exports = extend;

function extend(...sources) {
    const target = {};

    sources.forEach(source => {
        Object.keys(source).forEach(key => {
            target[key] = source[key];
        });
    });

    return target;
}
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports four entities: `walk`, `walkStream`, `walkSync`, and `Settings`. These entities are imported from two other modules: `./walk` and `./settings`. The code is using the `Object.defineProperty` method to define properties on the exports object, which allows those properties to be enumerable and their values are lazily retrieved using getter functions. This means the actual import value is not fetched until it is accessed, which can help with performance and reducing initial load times.

Below is a possible rewrite of the provided Node.js code, achieving the same functionality but utilizing ES6 import and export syntax for better readability.

```javascript
"use strict";

import { walk, walkStream, walkSync } from './walk';
import { Settings } from './settings';

export { walk, walkStream, walkSync, Settings };
```

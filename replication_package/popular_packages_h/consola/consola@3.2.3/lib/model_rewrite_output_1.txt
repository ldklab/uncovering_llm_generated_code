The given Node.js code dynamically exports properties from a module located at "../dist/index.cjs". Here's the breakdown of its functionality:

1. It imports a CommonJS module (`index.cjs`) located in the "../dist" directory and assigns it to the variable `lib`.

2. It specifically exports the `consola` property from the `lib` object as the main export of the current module, using `module.exports`.

3. It then iterates over all properties of the `lib` object.

4. For each property in `lib`, it checks if the property is not already directly exported through `module.exports`.

5. If a property is not already exported, it adds that property to `module.exports`, effectively merging the entire `lib` object into the module exports, while maintaining `consola` as the default export.

The rewritten version of the code is as follows:

```javascript
const lib = require("../dist/index.cjs");

module.exports = {
  ...lib.consola,
  ...lib
};
```

Note: This rewrite assumes that `lib.consola` is spreadable (like an object). If `lib.consola` is not an object or if it should remain the primary export, the behavior might slightly differ, and a different approach might be needed to respect the original structure.

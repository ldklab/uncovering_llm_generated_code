The Node.js code is essentially exporting certain JavaScript module functionalities from a library located at "../dist/index.cjs". It first imports the library into `lib`. Then, it specifically exports the `consola` object of `lib` as the main module export. After that, it iterates over all the properties of the `lib` object. If any property in `lib` is not already a property of `module.exports`, it adds that property to `module.exports`. This ensures that all properties of `lib` become part of the module's exports, with the `consola` object having the primary focus.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
const lib = require("../dist/index.cjs");

module.exports = { ...lib.consola };

Object.keys(lib).forEach((key) => {
  if (!module.exports.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    module.exports[key] = lib[key];
  }
});
```

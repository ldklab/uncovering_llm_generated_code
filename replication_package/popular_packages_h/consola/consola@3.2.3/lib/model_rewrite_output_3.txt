The given Node.js code is performing the following functionality:

1. It imports a module from the specified relative path `"../dist/index.cjs"` and assigns it to a variable named `lib`.
2. It then exports the `consola` property of the `lib` object as its main export.
3. The code iterates over all the keys in the `lib` object.
4. For each key in the `lib`, it checks if that key is not already present in `module.exports`.
5. If a key is not present, it adds that key-value pair to `module.exports`.

This means the code is primarily exporting the `consola` object, but it also appends any additional properties from `lib` to `module.exports` if they do not conflict with any existing properties.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
const lib = require("../dist/index.cjs");

const exportsObject = {
  ...lib.consola,  // Start off with consola properties
};

// Append any additional properties from lib
for (const key of Object.keys(lib)) {
  if (!exportsObject.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    exportsObject[key] = lib[key];
  }
}

module.exports = exportsObject;
```

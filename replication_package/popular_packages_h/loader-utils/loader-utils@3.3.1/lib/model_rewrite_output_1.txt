The provided Node.js code performs the following functions:

1. It imports four modules or functions: `isUrlRequest`, `urlToRequest`, `getHashDigest`, and `interpolateName`. These modules appear to be located within the same directory since they are referenced with a relative path (`./`).

2. The code then exports these four imported modules/functions. This allows them to be used in other files by importing them from this script.

To rewrite this code, maintain its functionality by also importing the four modules and subsequently exporting them.

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import local modules/functions
const isUrlRequest = require("./isUrlRequest");
const urlToRequest = require("./urlToRequest");
const getHashDigest = require("./getHashDigest");
const interpolateName = require("./interpolateName");

// Export the imported modules/functions
module.exports = {
  isUrlRequest,
  urlToRequest,
  getHashDigest,
  interpolateName
};
```

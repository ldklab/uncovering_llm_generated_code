The given Node.js code is a module that exports four utility functions, which are imported from separate files. These functions are likely to be related to handling URLs and file names, possibly for a toolchain or build process:

1. `isUrlRequest`: A function possibly used to determine if a given input should be interpreted as a URL.
2. `urlToRequest`: A function likely responsible for converting a URL to a request format suitable for the application's requirements.
3. `getHashDigest`: A function probably used to generate a hash digest from given data, which is commonly used for creating unique identifiers or cache-busting in assets management.
4. `interpolateName`: A function likely used to create or interpolate names based on certain patterns or templates, often used in file naming conventions during builds.

Here is a rewritten version of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const isUrlRequest = require("./isUrlRequest");
const urlToRequest = require("./urlToRequest");
const getHashDigest = require("./getHashDigest");
const interpolateName = require("./interpolateName");

module.exports = {
    isUrlRequest,
    urlToRequest,
    getHashDigest,
    interpolateName,
};
```

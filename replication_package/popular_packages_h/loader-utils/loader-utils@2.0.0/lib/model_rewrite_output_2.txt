The given Node.js code snippet is a module file that's importing various utility functions from separate files and then re-exporting them as part of the module's exports. This design allows other modules to import these utility functions and use them in their own code. Each utility function likely provides some specific functionality that can be helpful in handling requests, parsing queries, processing URLs, and working with strings in the context in which this module is used.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const utilities = {
  getOptions: require('./getOptions'),
  parseQuery: require('./parseQuery'),
  stringifyRequest: require('./stringifyRequest'),
  getRemainingRequest: require('./getRemainingRequest'),
  getCurrentRequest: require('./getCurrentRequest'),
  isUrlRequest: require('./isUrlRequest'),
  urlToRequest: require('./urlToRequest'),
  parseString: require('./parseString'),
  getHashDigest: require('./getHashDigest'),
  interpolateName: require('./interpolateName'),
};

module.exports = utilities;
```

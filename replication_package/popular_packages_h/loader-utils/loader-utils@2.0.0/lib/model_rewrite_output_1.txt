The given Node.js code is a module that exports a series of utility functions from separate files. Each function presumably performs a specific task, which is implied by its name. The module organizes these utilities so that they can be easily imported and used in other parts of an application. The code uses CommonJS syntax to import each utility function and then assigns them to properties of the `exports` object, making them available to other modules that `require` this file.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Importing required utility functions from their respective files
const utilities = {
  getOptions: require('./getOptions'),
  parseQuery: require('./parseQuery'),
  stringifyRequest: require('./stringifyRequest'),
  getRemainingRequest: require('./getRemainingRequest'),
  getCurrentRequest: require('./getCurrentRequest'),
  isUrlRequest: require('./isUrlRequest'),
  urlToRequest: require('./urlToRequest'),
  parseString: require('./parseString'),
  getHashDigest: require('./getHashDigest'),
  interpolateName: require('./interpolateName')
};

// Exporting the utilities as module exports
module.exports = utilities;
```

This rewrite consolidates the import and export operations into a single object and uses `module.exports` to expose these utilities.

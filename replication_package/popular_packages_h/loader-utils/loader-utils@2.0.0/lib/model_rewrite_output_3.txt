The Node.js code provided is exporting various utility functions from different modules to be used elsewhere in an application. Each of these functions seemingly handles common tasks you might encounter in a web application or build toolchain, such as parsing options and queries, handling URL requests, manipulating strings, and more. Essentially, the code provides a way to consolidate and expose these functionalities through exports for usage in other parts of an application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import utility functions from their respective modules
const {
  getOptions, 
  parseQuery, 
  stringifyRequest, 
  getRemainingRequest, 
  getCurrentRequest, 
  isUrlRequest, 
  urlToRequest, 
  parseString, 
  getHashDigest, 
  interpolateName 
} = require('./utils');

// Export all imported functions for use in other modules
module.exports = {
  getOptions,
  parseQuery,
  stringifyRequest,
  getRemainingRequest,
  getCurrentRequest,
  isUrlRequest,
  urlToRequest,
  parseString,
  getHashDigest,
  interpolateName
};
```

Note: The rewritten code assumes that all the utility functions are consolidated in a single module named `./utils`.

The given Node.js code is importing certain factory functions and a promise-wrapped git runner from other modules. These components are then combined using a factory pattern to construct and export a module. Specifically, it follows these steps:

1. `gitP` is imported from a local module located in './lib/runners/promise-wrapped'. This presumably provides a promise-based interface to some git functionality.
2. Three factories are imported from `./git-factory`: `esModuleFactory`, `gitInstanceFactory`, and `gitExportFactory`.
3. The `gitExportFactory` function is called with `gitInstanceFactory` and an object containing `gitP`. This returns a value or an object configured using these dependencies.
4. The result from `gitExportFactory` is then passed into `esModuleFactory`, which constructs a module in a format compatible with ES module imports/exports.
5. Finally, the resultant module from `esModuleFactory` is exported using CommonJS module exports.

Here is a rewritten version of the code that maintains the same functionality:

```javascript
const { gitP } = require('./lib/runners/promise-wrapped');
const { esModuleFactory, gitInstanceFactory, gitExportFactory } = require('./git-factory');

const gitModule = esModuleFactory(
    gitExportFactory(gitInstanceFactory, { gitP })
);

module.exports = gitModule;
```

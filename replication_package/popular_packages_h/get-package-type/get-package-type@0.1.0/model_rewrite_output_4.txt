The Node.js code provided is a module that exports functionality to determine the type of a package based on a given filename. There are two variants of this functionality: one asynchronous and one synchronous. 

1. The first line uses strict mode by including `'use strict';`, which helps with catching common coding errors and "unsafe" actions.
2. Two functions are required from other files, `getPackageType` from `./async.cjs` and `getPackageTypeSync` from `./sync.cjs`. Presumably, these files contain the logic for determining the package type asynchronously and synchronously, respectively.
3. The module exports a single function that uses `getPackageType` (asynchronous) when `module.exports(filename)` is called.
4. Additionally, the synchronous version of the function, `getPackageTypeSync`, is attached to the `sync` property of `module.exports`, allowing users to call it with `module.exports.sync(filename)`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const determinePackageTypeAsync = require('./async.cjs');
const determinePackageTypeSync = require('./sync.cjs');

function getPackageType(filename) {
    return determinePackageTypeAsync(filename);
}

getPackageType.sync = function(filename) {
    return determinePackageTypeSync(filename);
};

module.exports = getPackageType;
```

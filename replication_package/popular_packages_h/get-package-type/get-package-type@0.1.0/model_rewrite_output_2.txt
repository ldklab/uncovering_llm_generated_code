The provided Node.js code is a module that exports two functions for determining the type of a package, such as whether a file belongs to a CommonJS or an ES module package. This functionality is based on the two imported modules: `./async.cjs` and `./sync.cjs`. The module exports an asynchronous function, which is the default export, and a synchronous function, attached as a property named `sync` to the exported function.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Importing asynchronous and synchronous functions from respective modules
const determinePackageTypeAsync = require('./async.cjs');
const determinePackageTypeSync = require('./sync.cjs');

// Exporting the asynchronous package type determination function as the default export
module.exports = filename => determinePackageTypeAsync(filename);

// Attaching the synchronous package type determination function as a property to the default function
module.exports.sync = determinePackageTypeSync;
```

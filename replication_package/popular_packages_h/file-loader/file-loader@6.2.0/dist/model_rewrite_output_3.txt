The Node.js code provided does the following:

1. Ensures strict mode is enabled, which is a JavaScript directive that helps catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions.
2. Imports a module or object from a file named `index.js`. This is done through the `require` function, which is used to include modules that exist in separate files.
3. Exports the default export of the imported `loader` module. Generally, `loader.default` would refer to the default object or function that has been exported from the `index.js` file.
4. Additionally, it directly exports the `raw` property of the `loader` object. This suggests that `loader` might be an object with various properties, and one of these properties is explicitly named `raw`.

A possible rewritten version of the Node.js code is as follows:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require('./index');

module.exports = indexModule.default;
module.exports.raw = indexModule.raw;
```

The given Node.js code is a module that exports functionality from another module located in './index'. It achieves this by requiring the './index' module and then exporting its default export as the main export of the current module. Additionally, it also exports a property called `raw` from the `loader` module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code that maintains the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport, raw } = require('./index');

module.exports = defaultExport;
module.exports.raw = raw;
```

The provided Node.js code is for a module that enhances the Node.js environment with shell-like commands, inspired by Unix shell commands. The module allows for running these commands synchronously. The key functionalities include loading default shell commands, defining certain configuration settings like `silent`, `fatal`, and `verbose`, and handling environment variables. The code uses `process.exit` for terminating the application and offers an interface for piping commands, akin to Unix shells. It also provides mechanisms to reset configurations to default states.

Below is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// ShellJS module for Unix-like shell commands in Node.js environment

const common = require('./src/common');
const commands = require('./commands');

// Load and initialize all default shell commands
commands.forEach(command => require('./src/' + command));

// Export common shell features and configurations
module.exports = {
  exit: process.exit, // Exit process with specified code

  error: require('./src/error'), // Error handling included

  ShellString: common.ShellString, // Utility for shell string processing

  // Environment variable access (getter/setter)
  env: process.env,

  // Configuration options
  config: {
    ...common.config,

    // Function to reset configuration to default values
    reset() {
      this.fatal = false;
      this.globOptions = {};
      this.maxdepth = 255;
      this.noglob = false;
      this.silent = false;
      this.verbose = false;
    }
  }
};
```

This restructured version performs the same functionality as outlined above, with ES6 features like `const` for requiring modules, and a more clear assignment of configuration resetting within the exported module.

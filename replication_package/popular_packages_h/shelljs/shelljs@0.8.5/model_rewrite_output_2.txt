The given Node.js code is a part of a wrapper library around Unix shell commands for Node.js, known as ShellJS. The functionality of this code is as follows:

1. **Importing Dependencies**: It starts by requiring a common module and other command modules dynamically. This sets up the environment to give access to various shell-like commands.

2. **Exporting Commands**: Various shell commands and attributes are exported as properties of the `exports` object, making them accessible from the module.

3. **Command Loading**: It loads and executes all the default shell-like command modules found in a specific directory (`./commands` and `./src/`).

4. **Process Control**: The `exit` function is directly mapped to `process.exit`, enabling the script to terminate execution with a specific exit code.

5. **Error Handling**: A mechanism to handle errors is provided through the `error` module.

6. **Environment Variables**: The `exports.env` object acts as a shortcut for accessing and modifying `process.env`, which contains environment variables.

7. **Pipes and Chaining**: It allows commands to be piped and chained in a similar way to Unix shell pipes. This enables users to process text streams progressively with methods like `grep`, `sed`, and `cat`.

8. **Configuration Management**: Provides a configuration object `exports.config` to manipulate the behavior of the shell.js commands. Configurations include `silent`, `fatal`, `verbose`, and `globOptions`. Additionally, a `reset` function is available to revert configurations to their default settings.

9. **Documentation**: Comments in the form of structured docstrings explain the usage of each feature and provide examples.

Here is the node.js code rewritten based on the functionality described:

```javascript
// ShellJS: Unix shell commands on top of Node's API.

const common = require('./src/common');
const commands = require('./commands');

// Expose functionality for each default command
commands.forEach(command => {
  require(`./src/${command}`);
});

// Export core functions and properties
exports.exit = process.exit;
exports.error = require('./src/error');
exports.ShellString = common.ShellString;
exports.env = process.env;
exports.config = common.config;

// Documentation: These exports facilitate interaction with Unix-like shell commands in Node.js,
// providing flexibility and shell scripting capabilities.

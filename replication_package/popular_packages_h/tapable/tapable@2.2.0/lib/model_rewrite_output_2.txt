The provided Node.js code is exporting different hook classes from various files. These classes are likely related to a pub/sub (publish/subscribe) or event handling system. Hooks are available in different versions, including synchronous (`SyncHook`, `SyncBailHook`, etc.) and asynchronous (`AsyncParallelHook`, `AsyncSeriesHook`, etc.) types. The purpose of these hooks is to manage event-driven programming patterns, allowing users to register functions (listeners) that are called (fired) when specific events occur. The hooks come in variations like bail, loop, waterfall, etc., each with specific behavior on how listeners are executed and how they affect the overall hook process. Additionally, `HookMap` and `MultiHook` serve specialized purposes, such as managing multiple hooks or organizing hooks in a map-like structure.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

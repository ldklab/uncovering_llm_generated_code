The provided Node.js code is an export module setup for a package that deals with hooks, particularly useful in event-driven programming. This module is exporting several types of hooks, both synchronous and asynchronous. The hooks are imported from their respective files and are then attached to the `exports` object so they can be used by other files or modules. This likely belongs to a library similar to Webpack's tapable library which provides an infrastructure for building event-driven systems with hooks.

Here is a potential rewrite of the code:

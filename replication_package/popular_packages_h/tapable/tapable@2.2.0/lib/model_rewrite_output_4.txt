The Node.js code provides an export module definition for a package that deals with various types of hooks. Hooks are functions that let you tap into the lifecycle of certain events or data processes to run custom functionality. This module exports several types of hooks, both synchronous and asynchronous, by requiring them from their respective files and making them available as part of the module's exports. The types of hooks include:

- `SyncHook`, `SyncBailHook`, `SyncWaterfallHook`, and `SyncLoopHook`: Different variations of synchronous hooks.
- `AsyncParallelHook`, `AsyncParallelBailHook`, `AsyncSeriesHook`, `AsyncSeriesBailHook`, `AsyncSeriesLoopHook`, and `AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook`: Variations of asynchronous hooks for managing operations that may not return results immediately.
- `HookMap` and `MultiHook`: Additional utilities to work with hooks.

Here's the rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const SyncHook = require("./SyncHook");
const SyncBailHook = require("./SyncBailHook");
const SyncWaterfallHook = require("./SyncWaterfallHook");
const SyncLoopHook = require("./SyncLoopHook");
const AsyncParallelHook = require("./AsyncParallelHook");
const AsyncParallelBailHook = require("./AsyncParallelBailHook");
const AsyncSeriesHook = require("./AsyncSeriesHook");
const AsyncSeriesBailHook = require("./AsyncSeriesBailHook");
const AsyncSeriesLoopHook = require("./AsyncSeriesLoopHook");
const AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook = require("./AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook");
const HookMap = require("./HookMap");
const MultiHook = require("./MultiHook");

module.exports = {
  SyncHook,
  SyncBailHook,
  SyncWaterfallHook,
  SyncLoopHook,
  AsyncParallelHook,
  AsyncParallelBailHook,
  AsyncSeriesHook,
  AsyncSeriesBailHook,
  AsyncSeriesLoopHook,
  AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook,
  HookMap,
  MultiHook
};
```

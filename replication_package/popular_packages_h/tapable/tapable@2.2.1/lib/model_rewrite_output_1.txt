This Node.js code is exporting several hook-related modules with ES module style exports. Each named export corresponds to a hook type, which is presumably defined in separate files within the same directory. The modules are likely related to a library concerning event handling or plug-in systems, similar to what might be found in libraries like Webpack (also authored by Tobias Koppers). The files such as `./SyncHook`, `./SyncBailHook`, and so on are being required and then exported under the same name, making these modules available to be imported elsewhere using these named exports. 

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import hook modules
const SyncHook = require("./SyncHook");
const SyncBailHook = require("./SyncBailHook");
const SyncWaterfallHook = require("./SyncWaterfallHook");
const SyncLoopHook = require("./SyncLoopHook");
const AsyncParallelHook = require("./AsyncParallelHook");
const AsyncParallelBailHook = require("./AsyncParallelBailHook");
const AsyncSeriesHook = require("./AsyncSeriesHook");
const AsyncSeriesBailHook = require("./AsyncSeriesBailHook");
const AsyncSeriesLoopHook = require("./AsyncSeriesLoopHook");
const AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook = require("./AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook");
const HookMap = require("./HookMap");
const MultiHook = require("./MultiHook");

// Export modules
module.exports = {
  SyncHook,
  SyncBailHook,
  SyncWaterfallHook,
  SyncLoopHook,
  AsyncParallelHook,
  AsyncParallelBailHook,
  AsyncSeriesHook,
  AsyncSeriesBailHook,
  AsyncSeriesLoopHook,
  AsyncSeriesWaterfallHook,
  HookMap,
  MultiHook
};
```

The Node.js code above exports a command-line interface (CLI) tool from a module located in the `./dist/index` path. It primarily exports the `cac` function for backwards compatibility, but also exports the `CAC` and `Command` classes, making them accessible to any module that requires this file. Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const { cac, CAC, Command } = require('./dist/index');

// Export the `cac` function, primarily for backwards compatibility
module.exports = cac;

// Extend the exports to include default, cac, CAC, and Command properties
Object.assign(module.exports, {
  default: cac,
  cac,
  CAC,
  Command,
});
```

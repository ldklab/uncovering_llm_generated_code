The Node.js code is exporting components related to CLI creation, which are imported from a build file located at `./dist/index`. The main export is the `cac` function, which is likely a factory for creating command-line interfaces. For backwards compatibility, the module also assigns `default` to `cac`, ensuring that importing this module using an import default syntax will work the same way as importing `cac`. Additionally, the code exports `CAC` and `Command` classes or functions, providing additional tools or constructs related to CLI usage.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const { cac, CAC, Command } = require('./dist/index');

// Main export of the module
exports = module.exports = cac;

// Additional exports for compatibility and additional tools
exports.default = cac;
exports.cac = cac;
exports.CAC = CAC;
exports.Command = Command;
```

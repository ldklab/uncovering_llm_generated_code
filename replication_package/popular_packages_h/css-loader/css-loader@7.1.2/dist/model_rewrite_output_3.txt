The Node.js code provided exports functionality from two different sources. First, it imports a module called `loader` from a file named `index.js` located in the same directory. It then exports the default export of this `loader` module, which allows other parts of the application to easily import and use this default functionality. Additionally, it imports a utility function named `defaultGetLocalIdent` from another file named `utils.js`, also located in the same directory, and exports this function under the same name. This allows other parts of the application to use this specific utility function as well.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Importing the loader module from the local index.js file
const loader = require("./index");

// Re-exporting the default export of the loader module
module.exports = loader.default;

// Importing the defaultGetLocalIdent from the local utils.js file
const { defaultGetLocalIdent } = require("./utils");

// Re-exporting the defaultGetLocalIdent function
module.exports.defaultGetLocalIdent = defaultGetLocalIdent;
```

The provided Node.js code snippet performs the following actions:

1. It enforces strict mode by using `"use strict";`. This helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables inadvertently.

2. It imports a module using `require` from a file named `index` located in the same directory.

3. It exports the default property of the imported module, making it available for other modules to use.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require('./index');

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

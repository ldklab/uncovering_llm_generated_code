The provided Node.js code exports the default export of a module named `index`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code's functionality:

1. It starts in strict mode by using `"use strict";`. This helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables.

2. It requires the `index` module and assigns it to the variable `loader`. The `index` module is expected to be a file in the same directory as this script (`./index`).

3. It exports the default export of the `index` module. This means that whatever is the default export object or function of `index` becomes the export of this current module as well.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require('./index');

module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

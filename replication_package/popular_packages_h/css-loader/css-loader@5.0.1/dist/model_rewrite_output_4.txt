This Node.js code is a simple module that imports a `loader` object from a local file named `index`. It then exports the default property of the `loader` object. This pattern is typically used to re-export a specific property (in this case, `default`) from another module, making it easier to import and use in other parts of the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the loader from the local 'index' file, which is expected to export an object with a default property.
const { default: defaultLoader } = require('./index');

// Export the default property so it can be easily imported in other modules.
module.exports = defaultLoader;
```

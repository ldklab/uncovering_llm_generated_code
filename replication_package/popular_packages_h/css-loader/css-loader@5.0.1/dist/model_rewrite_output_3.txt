The given Node.js code is a module that imports a module named `index` (located in the same directory) using the `require` function. It then exports the `default` export of the imported module, making it available to other files that require this module. The `"use strict";` directive is used to enable strict mode which helps in writing more secure JavaScript code by catching common coding errors.

Here is a rewritten version:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require('./index');

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

The Node.js code is effectively exporting the functionality or contents of a module named `syntax` from a relative path. That means whatever is being exported from the `syntax.js` file (or `syntax` directory with an `index.js` file) is being re-exported by this file. This is useful if you want to create a simpler or more descriptive entry point for a module, ensuring that the consumers of the module can import it from a different or more convenient path.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// Re-export everything from the './syntax' module
const syntaxModule = require('./syntax');

// Export the syntax module for external use
module.exports = syntaxModule;
```

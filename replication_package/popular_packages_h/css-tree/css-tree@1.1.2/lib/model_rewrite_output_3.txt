The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports whatever is exported by the module located in the file named `syntax` which is in the same directory as the current file. This enables another JavaScript file to import the exports from `syntax.js` by importing this file instead.

Here's a possible rewrite for the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Import and re-export the module from 'syntax.js'
const syntaxModule = require('./syntax');

module.exports = syntaxModule;
```

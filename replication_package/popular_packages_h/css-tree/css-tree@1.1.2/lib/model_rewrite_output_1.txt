The functionality of the provided Node.js code is quite straightforward. The code essentially exports whatever is being exported from the module located in the 'syntax.js' file (the '.js' extension is implicit and not required). By using `require('./syntax')`, it imports the exported content of that file, and then with `module.exports =`, it makes that content available for other modules that might need to import it.

Here's a rewritten version of this code, demonstrating the same functionality:

```javascript
const syntaxModule = require('./syntax');
module.exports = syntaxModule;
```

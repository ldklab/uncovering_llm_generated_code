The given Node.js code exports the contents of another module. Specifically, it imports whatever is exported by the `./syntax` module and then re-exports it as the module's own export. This pattern is often used to create cleaner module organization or to re-export modules from different paths without directly exposing internal module structure to users.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import the module exported by the './syntax' file
const syntaxModule = require('./syntax');

// Re-export the imported module, making its exports available directly
module.exports = syntaxModule;
```

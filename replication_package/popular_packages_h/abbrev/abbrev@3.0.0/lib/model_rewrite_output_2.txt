The given Node.js code defines and exports a function called `abbrev`. The purpose of this function is to create a mapping of all possible abbreviations of a given list of strings to their full string equivalents. If the function is called with a single array argument, it uses that array; otherwise, it uses all provided arguments as the list of strings.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. It first checks if there is only one argument and if it's an array. If so, it assigns the array to the `list` variable; otherwise, it treats all arguments as the list.
2. It ensures all elements in the list are strings by converting non-string elements.
3. The strings in the list are sorted lexicographically.
4. It then iterates through the list to generate abbreviations:
   - For each string, it checks how much of it matches with its previous and next neighbors in the list.
   - Abbreviations are generated based on these matched characters.
5. A lexicographic sorting function (`lexSort`) is used to help maintain order when comparing elements.

Below is a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
module.exports = abbrev;

function abbrev(...args) {
  let list = args.length === 1 && Array.isArray(args[0]) ? args[0] : args;

  list = list.map(item => String(item)).sort(lexSort);

  const abbrevs = {};
  let previousItem = '';

  for (let currentIndex = 0; currentIndex < list.length; currentIndex++) {
    const currentItem = list[currentIndex];
    const nextItem = list[currentIndex + 1] || '';

    if (currentItem === nextItem) continue;

    let commonLength = 0;
    while (
      commonLength < currentItem.length &&
      (currentItem.charAt(commonLength) === nextItem.charAt(commonLength) ||
       currentItem.charAt(commonLength) === previousItem.charAt(commonLength))
    ) {
      commonLength++;
    }

    abbrevs[currentItem] = currentItem;
    for (let i = 1; i <= commonLength; i++) {
      abbrevs[currentItem.slice(0, i)] = currentItem;
    }

    previousItem = currentItem;
  }

  return abbrevs;
}

function lexSort(a, b) {
  return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0;
}
```

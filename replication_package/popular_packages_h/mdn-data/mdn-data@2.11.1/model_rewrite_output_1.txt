The given Node.js code is exporting three different modules: `api`, `css`, and `l10n`. Each of these modules is required from their respective files located in the same directory. This code allows other parts of the application to import and use these functionalities.

Here's the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const api = require('./api');
const css = require('./css');
const l10n = require('./l10n');

module.exports = {
  api,
  css,
  l10n,
};
```

The given Node.js code is exporting an object with three properties: `api`, `css`, and `l10n`. Each of these properties is being set to the value returned by requiring a respective module file (`./api`, `./css`, `./l10n`). This structure is commonly used for organizing code where different functionalities are separated into different modules/files and then exported together as a single object. This design allows for these modules to be easily imported and used together in other parts of a larger application.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const apiModule = require('./api');
const cssModule = require('./css');
const l10nModule = require('./l10n');

module.exports = {
  api: apiModule,
  css: cssModule,
  l10n: l10nModule,
};
```

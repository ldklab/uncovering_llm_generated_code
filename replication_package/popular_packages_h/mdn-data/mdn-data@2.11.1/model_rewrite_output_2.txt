The given Node.js code exports three modules as a single object. These modules are `api`, `css`, and `l10n`, and they are being required from their respective files located in the same directory. By setting up the exports in this way, it allows other parts of the application to import all three modules in a single statement, making the code more organized and modular.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code based on the explanation:

```javascript
const api = require('./api');
const css = require('./css');
const l10n = require('./l10n');

module.exports = { api, css, l10n };
```

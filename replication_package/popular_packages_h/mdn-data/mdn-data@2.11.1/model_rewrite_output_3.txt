The provided Node.js code is a module export file. It imports three other modules from the current directory named `api`, `css`, and `l10n`. These imports are assigned as properties of an object which is then exported as a single module. This allows other files to import this module and gain access to the functionalities provided by `api`, `css`, and `l10n` in one unified import.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Importing individual modules
const apiModule = require('./api');
const cssModule = require('./css');
const l10nModule = require('./l10n');

// Exporting the imported modules as a single module
module.exports = {
  api: apiModule,
  css: cssModule,
  l10n: l10nModule,
};
```

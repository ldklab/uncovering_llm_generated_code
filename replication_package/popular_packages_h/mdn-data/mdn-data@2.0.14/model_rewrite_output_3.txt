The given Node.js code is a module export statement. It exports three different modules (`api`, `css`, and `l10n`) which are imported using the `require` function. These three modules are expected to be located in the same directory as the current file, each in their own JavaScript files named `api.js`, `css.js`, and `l10n.js` respectively. This allows other files to import these modules easily using this file as an interface.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
const apiModule = require('./api');
const cssModule = require('./css');
const l10nModule = require('./l10n');

module.exports = {
  api: apiModule,
  css: cssModule,
  l10n: l10nModule,
};
```

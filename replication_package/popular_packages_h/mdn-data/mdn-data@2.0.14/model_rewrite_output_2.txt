The provided Node.js code is a module that exports three different functionalities from separate files. Each of these functionalities—`api`, `css`, and `l10n`—is imported using the `require` statement from their respective files located in the same directory. These imports are then aggregated into an object, which is being made available for export, thereby allowing other files to import and use these functionalities.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const api = require('./api');
const css = require('./css');
const l10n = require('./l10n');

module.exports = {
  api: api,
  css: css,
  l10n: l10n,
};
```

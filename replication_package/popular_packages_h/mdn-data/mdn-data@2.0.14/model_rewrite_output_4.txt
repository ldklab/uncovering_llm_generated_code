The functionality of this Node.js code is to export an object that consolidates several modules or functionalities (specifically `api`, `css`, and `l10n`) from their respective files located presumably in the same directory. This allows these modules to be imported together as a single module elsewhere in the application.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const api = require('./api');
const css = require('./css');
const l10n = require('./l10n');

module.exports = {
  api,
  css,
  l10n,
};
```

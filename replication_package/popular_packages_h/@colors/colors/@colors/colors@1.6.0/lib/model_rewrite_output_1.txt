The Node.js code is a module that handles color formatting in terminal output. It requires a module named `colors` and then exports it. By default, it extends the `String.prototype` with methods for adding colors to strings. There is also a comment explaining how to use colors without modifying the `String.prototype` by requiring a different variant of the module (`@colors/colors/safe`). Finally, it requires another module `./extendStringPrototype`, which is probably responsible for applying the extension to `String.prototype`.

Here's a possible rewrite:

```javascript
const colors = require('./colors');
module.exports = colors;

// Commented alternative usage for non-extension of String.prototype:
// const colors = require('@colors/colors/safe');
// console.log(colors.red("foo"));

require('./extendStringPrototype')();
```

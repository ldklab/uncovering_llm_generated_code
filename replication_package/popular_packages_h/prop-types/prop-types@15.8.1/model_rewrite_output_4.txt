The Node.js code is a module that exports functionality that varies based on the environment in which it's run. It is part of the "prop-types" package, which is commonly used in React applications to perform type-checking of component props. The code checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine if it is in a production environment:

1. **Development Environment (`NODE_ENV !== 'production')`:**
   - It requires the `react-is` package.
   - It sets a boolean flag `throwOnDirectAccess` to true to enable new development behavior.
   - The module exports a function from `factoryWithTypeCheckers` with `ReactIs.isElement` and `throwOnDirectAccess` as parameters, which allows for runtime type-checking with direct access warnings.

2. **Production Environment (`NODE_ENV === 'production')`:**
   - The module exports a function from `factoryWithThrowingShims`, which provides production behavior that is likely more minimal or optimized.

This pattern ensures that during development, developers receive detailed warnings or errors, while in production, the checks are either minimized or omitted to enhance performance.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript

const ReactIs = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? require('react-is') : null;
const throwOnDirectAccess = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

const moduleExport = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
  ? require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(ReactIs.isElement, throwOnDirectAccess)
  : require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();

module.exports = moduleExport;
```

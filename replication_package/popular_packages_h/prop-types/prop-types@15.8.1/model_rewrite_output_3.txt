The given Node.js code is a module conditionally exporting functionality based on the environment the code is currently running in, specifically whether it is in development or production mode:

1. **Non-Production Environment (e.g., development mode):**
   - The code imports the `react-is` package.
   - It configures a flag called `throwOnDirectAccess` to `true`.
   - It exports a module that is created by calling the `factoryWithTypeCheckers` function. This function is likely a factory for creating type checker functions for React components.

2. **Production Environment:**
   - It exports a module from `factoryWithThrowingShims`. This could be a function that provides dummy or minimal implementations of type checkers to potentially reduce the performance impact of the type checking in production.

The intention behind this setup is to provide rigorous type-checking in a development environment while reducing overhead in production to improve runtime performance.

Here's the rewritten code:

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

if (!isProduction) {
  const ReactIs = require('react-is');
  const throwOnDirectAccess = true;
  module.exports = require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(ReactIs.isElement, throwOnDirectAccess);
} else {
  module.exports = require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();
}

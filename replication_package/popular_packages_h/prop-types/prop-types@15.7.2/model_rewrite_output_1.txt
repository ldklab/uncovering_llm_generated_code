The provided Node.js code checks the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to determine if the current environment is a development or production environment. Based on the environment, it dynamically requires and exports different modules associated with `prop-types`, a library to check the types of React props.

- In a non-production (development) environment:
  - It requires the `react-is` module, which is used to verify element types within React.
  - It sets the variable `throwOnDirectAccess` to `true`, signaling that direct access should cause errors during development.
  - It exports the result of calling a module `factoryWithTypeCheckers`, passing in `ReactIs.isElement` and `throwOnDirectAccess`.

- In a production environment:
  - The module `factoryWithThrowingShims` is required and its result is exported.

This conditional behavior helps in utilizing more robust type-checking in development, while using more optimized or minimal type-checking in production.

```javascript
const ReactIs = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? require('react-is') : null;
const throwOnDirectAccess = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

module.exports = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
  ? require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(ReactIs.isElement, throwOnDirectAccess)
  : require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();
```

The given Node.js code checks the environment in which it's running by examining the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If the environment is not set to 'production', the code does the following:

1. Imports the `react-is` library.
2. Imports a module using `require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')`, passing it the `ReactIs.isElement` function and a flag (`throwOnDirectAccess`) set to `true`. This module is exported.

If the environment is set to 'production', it instead:

1. Imports a module using `require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')`, which is exported without any parameters.

The behavior is essentially to provide useful debugging information in a development environment (by using type checkers) while optimizing for performance by reducing error-checking overhead in a production environment (by using throwing shims).

Here's a possible rewrite:

const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

if (isDevelopment) {
  const ReactIs = require('react-is');

  const throwOnDirectAccess = true;
  const createTypeCheckers = require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers');
  
  module.exports = createTypeCheckers(ReactIs.isElement, throwOnDirectAccess);
} else {
  const createThrowingShims = require('./factoryWithThrowingShims');
  
  module.exports = createThrowingShims();
}
```

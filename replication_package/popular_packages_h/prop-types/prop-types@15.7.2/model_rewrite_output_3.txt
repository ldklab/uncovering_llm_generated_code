This Node.js code provides a conditional export mechanism for a module based on the environment. Specifically, it checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is not set to 'production'. If the environment is not production, it loads the `react-is` module, sets a flag `throwOnDirectAccess` to `true`, and exports the result of calling a function from `'./factoryWithTypeCheckers'` with `ReactIs.isElement` and the flag as arguments. If the environment is production, it simply exports the result of calling another function from `'./factoryWithThrowingShims'` without arguments. This setup suggests that the behavior of the module differs between development and production environments. In development, it might be checking types more strictly using external tools like `prop-types`, while in production, it might just throw shims to allow components to run but without as many checks.

Here is a rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
/**
 * Conditional module export based on environment setting.
 * Different behaviors for development and production environments.
 */

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const ReactIs = require('react-is');

  // Use prop-types in development for enhanced type checking
  const throwOnDirectAccess = true;
  module.exports = require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(ReactIs.isElement, throwOnDirectAccess);
} else {
  // Use simpler production behavior for prop-types
  module.exports = require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();
}
```

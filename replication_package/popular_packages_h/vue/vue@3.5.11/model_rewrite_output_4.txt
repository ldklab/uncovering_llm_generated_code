The provided Node.js code is a conditional module export pattern commonly seen in the context of using environment variables to control which file version to load. Specifically, it checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine the mode in which the application is running.

- If the `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the production build of a module. The file path suggested by `require('./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js')` is typically optimized for performance and smaller in size.

- If the `NODE_ENV` is any other value (including undefined), it exports the development build of the module. The file at `require('./dist/vue.cjs.js')` often includes warnings and any development-related overhead that is helpful for debugging.

This setup is useful in deployment scenarios where the production code should be optimized for performance, whereas the development code should facilitate easier debugging.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = env === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction ? './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js' : './dist/vue.cjs.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

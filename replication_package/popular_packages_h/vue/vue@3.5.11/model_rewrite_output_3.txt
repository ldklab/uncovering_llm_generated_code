The provided Node.js code is a simple module export condition based on the environment in which the Node.js application is running. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a 'production' or a 'non-production' (often 'development') environment. Depending on the environment, it exports either a production build or a development build of the Vue.js CommonJS module.

- If `NODE_ENV` equals 'production', the code exports the production version of Vue.js (`./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js`).
- Otherwise, it exports the development version of Vue.js (`./dist/vue.cjs.js`).

This setup is useful for optimizing the application during deployment. In a production environment, it would use the minified and optimized production build, while in a development environment, it would use a version with helpful warnings and debugging features.

Here is the possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const vuePath = isProduction ? './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js' : './dist/vue.cjs.js';
module.exports = require(vuePath);
```

The code is a conditional module export script written in Node.js. It checks the current environment by evaluating the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the production version of a module located at `'./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js'`. Otherwise, it exports a different version, presumably a development or non-optimized version, located at `'./dist/vue.cjs.js'`. This is a common practice for optimizing performance in production environments while using a more debug-friendly version during development.

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const productionModule = './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js';
const developmentModule = './dist/vue.cjs.js';

module.exports = require(isProduction ? productionModule : developmentModule);
```

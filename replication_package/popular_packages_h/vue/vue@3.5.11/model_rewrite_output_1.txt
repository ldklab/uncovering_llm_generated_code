The Node.js code is selecting which version of the Vue library to export based on the environment in which the code is running. If the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports the production version of the Vue library (`vue.cjs.prod.js`). Otherwise, it exports the development version (`vue.cjs.js`). This type of conditional export is typically used to optimize performance and debugging capabilities depending on the environment.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const path = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js' 
  : './dist/vue.cjs.js';

module.exports = require(path);
```

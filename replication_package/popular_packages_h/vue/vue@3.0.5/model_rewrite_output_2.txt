The given Node.js code snippet is a conditional module export that selects between two versions of a Vue.js module based on the current environment. It checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'production'`. If so, it exports the production version of the Vue.js module located at `'./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js'`. Otherwise, it exports the non-production (likely a development) version located at `'./dist/vue.cjs.js'`. This setup is common in JavaScript projects to optimize performance and debugging experience based on the environment.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
let modulePath;

if (env === 'production') {
  modulePath = './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js';
} else {
  modulePath = './dist/vue.cjs.js';
}

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

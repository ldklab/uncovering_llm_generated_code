The given Node.js code is a conditional export statement typically used in a library. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine which version of a CommonJS module should be exported. This mechanism is often used to separate production and development builds of a library, where:

- If the `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports the production build of a module located at `./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js`.
- Otherwise, it defaults to exporting the development build at `./dist/vue.cjs.js`.

The production version of a module typically includes optimizations to reduce size and enhance performance, while the development version contains additional warnings and error messages to assist developers during application development.

Hereâ€™s a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const prodPath = './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js';
const devPath = './dist/vue.cjs.js';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
module.exports = require(isProduction ? prodPath : devPath);
```

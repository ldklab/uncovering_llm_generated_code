The given Node.js script is used to conditionally export different versions of a module based on the environment in which the code is running. 

- It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
- If the environment is set to 'production', it exports the production build of the module, which is located at `./dist/vue.cjs.prod.js`. This version is usually optimized for performance and smaller bundle size.
- Otherwise (in other environments, such as development), it exports the development build of the same module from `./dist/vue.cjs.js`. This version usually includes extra warnings and debugging information useful during development.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = env === 'production';
const filePath = isProduction ? './dist/vue.cjs.prod.js' : './dist/vue.cjs.js';

module.exports = require(filePath);
```

The provided Node.js script is a UMD (Universal Module Definition) wrapper for the Angular Common module. It defines various Angular common features, such as directives and pipes, to work both in Node.js environments for server-side rendering and regular web browsers for client-side rendering. The script is aimed at supporting both CommonJS and AMD module loading systems, as well as using a global variable if neither is available.

Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:
- It sets up a UMD pattern to allow the module to work in different environments (Node.js, AMD, or as a global variable).
- It defines several utility classes and functions related to Angular's Common module features, including but not limited to Location, various directives like NgClass, NgForOf, and pipes like DatePipe and CurrencyPipe.
- It provides some utilities for locale management, number formatting, and other functionalities, mostly for internal Angular usage but also exposing some functionalities for application developers.
- The version number (`9.1.13`) indicates it is part of a specific Angular release.

Here's a simplified or formatted version of this UMD script, focusing on the structure and logic without actual implementation details:

```javascript
(function (global, factory) {
    if (typeof exports === 'object' && typeof module !== 'undefined') {
        factory(exports, require('@angular/core'));
    } else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
        define(['exports', '@angular/core'], factory);
    } else {
        factory((global.ng = global.ng || {}, global.ng.common = {}), global.ng.core);
    }
}(this, (function (exports, core) {
    'use strict';

    var VERSION = new core.Version('9.1.13');

    // Functions and classes defined here
    function getDOM() { /* ... */ }

    function setRootDomAdapter(adapter) { /* ... */ }

    function createBrowserPlatformLocation() {
        return new BrowserPlatformLocation(core.ɵɵinject(core.DOCUMENT));
    }

    // Other functionalities like pipes, directives
    var CommonModule = core.NgModule({
        declarations: [/* ... */],
        exports: [/* ... */],
        providers: [
            { provide: NgLocalization, useClass: NgLocaleLocalization }
        ]
    }).Class({
        constructor: function CommonModule() {}
    });

    // Additional classes and functionalities

    exports.VERSION = VERSION;
    exports.BrowserPlatformLocation = BrowserPlatformLocation;
    exports.CommonModule = CommonModule;
    // Other exports

    Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true });

})));
```

This script provides the basis for Angular's common functionality and is extensible for application-specific or cross-compatibility needs.

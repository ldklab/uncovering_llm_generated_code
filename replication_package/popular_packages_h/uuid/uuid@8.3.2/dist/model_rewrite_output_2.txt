The Node.js code provided is using ECMAScript module syntax to set up a module that exports several functionalities related to UUID operations. The code imports several modules and then defines specific properties on the `exports` object, making them available to other parts of a program that import this module. Each exported property corresponds to different functions or features like generating UUIDs of different versions (v1, v3, v4, v5), a NIL UUID, as well as utilities to version, validate, stringify, and parse UUIDs.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import v1 from './v1.js';
import v3 from './v3.js';
import v4 from './v4.js';
import v5 from './v5.js';
import nil from './nil.js';
import version from './version.js';
import validate from './validate.js';
import stringify from './stringify.js';
import parse from './parse.js';

export {
  v1,
  v3,
  v4,
  v5,
  nil as NIL,
  version,
  validate,
  stringify,
  parse
};
```
This refactored code uses ES6 module syntax to import and export the various UUID functionalities more concisely while retaining the same behavior.

The functionality of the given Node.js code is to set up module exports, specifically for cryptographic operations related to SHA-256 hashing. The code utilizes TypeScript's module system to export particular functionalities. It achieves the following:

1. It imports and re-exports all exports from the module located at "./crossPlatformSha256". This potentially includes multiple exports related to SHA-256 functionality that can work across different platforms.

2. It imports a specific object, `Sha256`, from the "./webCryptoSha256" module and re-exports it under the name `WebCryptoSha256`. This makes the `Sha256` function or class from `webCryptoSha256` accessible to other modules as `WebCryptoSha256`, likely providing a way to perform SHA-256 hashing via Web Crypto API mechanisms.

Here is a rewritten form of the provided code:

```typescript
"use strict";
import * as crossPlatformSha256 from "./crossPlatformSha256";
export * from "./crossPlatformSha256";

import { Sha256 as WebCryptoSha256 } from "./webCryptoSha256";
export { WebCryptoSha256 };
```

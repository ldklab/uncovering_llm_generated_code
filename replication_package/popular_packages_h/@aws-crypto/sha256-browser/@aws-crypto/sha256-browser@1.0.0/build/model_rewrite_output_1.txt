The provided Node.js code utilizes TypeScript features to create a module that exports cryptographic hash functions. It implements exports from three different files that likely provide different implementations of the SHA-256 hash function. Here's a detailed explanation of what each part does:

1. **Module Imports and Exports**:
    - It imports the `tslib` library, which is a runtime library for TypeScript that provides helper functions. This code uses `tslib`'s `__exportStar` function to export all exports from `./crossPlatformSha256`.
    - `crossPlatformSha256` is expected to contain a generic implementation of SHA-256 or related utilities that function across multiple environments.

2. **Named Export from ie11Sha256**:
    - This section imports the `ie11Sha256` module and specifically exports the `Sha256` class or function within it as `Ie11Sha256`.
    - This export is intended for use with Internet Explorer 11's JavaScript environment, indicating a potentially specialized implementation that accounts for IE11's compatibility issues.

3. **Named Export from webCryptoSha256**:
    - Similar to the previous section, it imports from `webCryptoSha256` and specifically exports a `Sha256` class or function as `WebCryptoSha256`.
    - This is likely an implementation that utilizes modern web cryptography APIs to provide efficient and secure hashing in environments where these APIs are available.

The module is primarily set up to allow different consumers to pick appropriate SHA-256 implementations based on the environment in which they are running (e.g., cross-platform, IE11, web crypto).

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const tslib_1 = require("tslib");

// Export everything from the crossPlatformSha256 module
tslib_1.__exportStar(require("./crossPlatformSha256"), exports);

const { Sha256: Ie11Sha256 } = require("./ie11Sha256");
Object.defineProperty(exports, "Ie11Sha256", { enumerable: true, get: () => Ie11Sha256 });

const { Sha256: WebCryptoSha256 } = require("./webCryptoSha256");
Object.defineProperty(exports, "WebCryptoSha256", { enumerable: true, get: () => WebCryptoSha256 });
```

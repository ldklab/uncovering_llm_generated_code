The Node.js code is organized as a module that exports functionality from other modules. The module utilizes the `tslib` library to handle TypeScript's common patterns like exporting from multiple files. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Import and Export with tslib**: It uses `tslib` to re-export all exports from another module located in `./crossPlatformSha256`, making them available at the top level of the current module.

2. **Export Specific Modules**:
   - `Ie11Sha256`: The code imports `Sha256` from `./ie11Sha256` and re-exports it under the name `Ie11Sha256`.
   - `WebCryptoSha256`: Similarly, it imports `Sha256` from `./webCryptoSha256` and re-exports it as `WebCryptoSha256`.

This module thus serves to bundle and simplify access to various implementations of SHA-256 hashing, potentially across different environments like IE11 or modern browsers with web crypto APIs.

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

var tslib_1 = require("tslib");
tslib_1.__exportStar(require("./crossPlatformSha256"), exports);

var ie11Sha256_1 = require("./ie11Sha256");
exports.Ie11Sha256 = ie11Sha256_1.Sha256;

var webCryptoSha256_1 = require("./webCryptoSha256");
exports.WebCryptoSha256 = webCryptoSha256_1.Sha256;
```

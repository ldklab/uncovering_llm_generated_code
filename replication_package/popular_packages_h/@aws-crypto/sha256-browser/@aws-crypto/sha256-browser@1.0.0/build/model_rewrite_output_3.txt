The provided Node.js code is a module that exports SHA-256 hashing functionality in a cross-platform manner. It uses TypeScript and `tslib` for potential TypeScript helper functions. The module re-exports everything from a file named `crossPlatformSha256`. It also specifically exports `Sha256` from two other files, `ie11Sha256` and `webCryptoSha256`, under new names `Ie11Sha256` and `WebCryptoSha256` respectively. These specific exports seem to support compatibility with different environments, potentially including Internet Explorer 11 and browsers that support the Web Crypto API.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
"use strict";
const tslib_1 = require("tslib");
tslib_1.__exportStar(require("./crossPlatformSha256"), exports);
const ie11Sha256_1 = require("./ie11Sha256");
exports.Ie11Sha256 = ie11Sha256_1.Sha256;
const webCryptoSha256_1 = require("./webCryptoSha256");
exports.WebCryptoSha256 = webCryptoSha256_1.Sha256;
```

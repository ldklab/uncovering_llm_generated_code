The provided Node.js code is a module that re-exports all the exports from another module located in a file called `jsSha256`. The code uses TypeScript's tslib library to facilitate the re-exporting process. The `__exportStar` function from `tslib` is used to re-export all exports from the specified module so that they can be conveniently imported from this module, `index.js`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

var jsSha256 = require("./jsSha256");
Object.keys(jsSha256).forEach(function(key) {
    if (key === "default" || key === "__esModule") return;
    exports[key] = jsSha256[key];
});
```

In this rewritten version, manual iteration over the keys of the `jsSha256` module is used to re-export its exports, excluding `default` and `__esModule` for compatibility with the usual CommonJS module export conventions.

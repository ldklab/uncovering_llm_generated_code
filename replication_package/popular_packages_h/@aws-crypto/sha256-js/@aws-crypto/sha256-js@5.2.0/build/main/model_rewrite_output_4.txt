The Node.js code is exporting all the exported members from the module located in the `./jsSha256` file and re-exporting them from the current module. It is using the `tslib` library's `__exportStar` function to achieve this. This is a common pattern in TypeScript projects for organizing and managing exports across different files.

Below is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

const { __exportStar } = require("tslib");

// Re-export everything from the './jsSha256' module
__exportStar(require("./jsSha256"), exports);
```

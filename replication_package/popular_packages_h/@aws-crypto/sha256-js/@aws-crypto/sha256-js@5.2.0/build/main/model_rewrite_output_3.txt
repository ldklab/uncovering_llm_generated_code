The given Node.js code is written using TypeScript and is a part of a module system. The code performs the following functions:

1. **Strict Mode**: The code begins with `"use strict";`, which is a directive to enable strict mode. This helps in catching common coding errors and prevents the use of certain JavaScript features that are considered to be problematic.

2. **Module Export**: The code uses `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });` which is a compatibility feature used by TypeScript when compiling to CommonJS modules. It sets the `__esModule` property to indicate that the module is an ES module.

3. **Import and Export with `tslib`**: The `tslib_1 = require("tslib");` line imports the `tslib` library, a runtime library for TypeScript that provides helper functions for TypeScript's output. 

4. **Export Star**: `tslib_1.__exportStar(require("./jsSha256"), exports);` re-exports all exports from the `./jsSha256` module. This is often used to consolidate and re-structure module exports when composing larger modules from smaller ones.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code using modern JavaScript (ES6+) style with the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";
import * as jsSha256 from "./jsSha256";
export * from "./jsSha256";

// This code assumes you are using a JavaScript module bundler like Webpack, 
// as ES6 module syntax is not directly compatible with Node.js CommonJS style.
```

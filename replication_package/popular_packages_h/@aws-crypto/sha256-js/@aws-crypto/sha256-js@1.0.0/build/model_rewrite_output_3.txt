The given Node.js code is utilizing TypeScript's module system along with some TypeScript helpers. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It sets up strict mode with `"use strict";`.
2. It imports the TypeScript utility known as `tslib`, which contains various helper functions that support TypeScript's compilation features.
3. The `__exportStar` function from `tslib` is used to re-export all exports from a module called `./jsSha256`. This means that all the exports from the `./jsSha256` module will also be available as exports from the current module.
4. The comment `//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map` indicates that a source map is available for this file, which helps in mapping the transpiled code back to the original TypeScript source, useful during debugging.

Now, let's rewrite this code with the same functionality but without using `tslib` to manage exports:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

var jsSha256 = require("./jsSha256");

Object.keys(jsSha256).forEach(function (key) {
    if (key === "default" || exports.hasOwnProperty(key)) return;
    exports[key] = jsSha256[key];
});
```

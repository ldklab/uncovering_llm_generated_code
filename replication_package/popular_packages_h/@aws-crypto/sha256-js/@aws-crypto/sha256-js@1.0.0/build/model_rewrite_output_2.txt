The given Node.js code is a module that re-exports all the exports from the `./jsSha256` module, making them available to other modules that import this one. It uses the `tslib` library for handling TypeScript's module system enhancements, specifically the `__exportStar` utility function. This function copies all exports from the specified module (`./jsSha256`) into the current module's exports. This way, anything that is exported from `./jsSha256` will also be available to users of this module without explicitly re-declaring them.

Let's rewrite this code with the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
module.exports = {
    ...require("./jsSha256")
};
```

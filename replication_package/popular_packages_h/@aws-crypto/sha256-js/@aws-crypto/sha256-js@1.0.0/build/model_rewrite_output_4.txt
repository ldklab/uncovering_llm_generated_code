The provided Node.js code is a module that re-exports all the exports from another module named `jsSha256`. This is often done to simplify module dependencies and create a central export point for related functionalities. Here's how it works:

1. It uses the `tslib` package to handle TypeScript helper functions. The `__exportStar` function from `tslib` is utilized to re-export all exports from the `./jsSha256` module.
2. The `Object.defineProperty` function is used to configure the `exports` object to indicate it is a module by setting the `__esModule` property to `true`.
3. The `//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map` comment at the end of the file is used for source map support, which helps in debugging by mapping the compiled code back to its original source.

The functionality of this module can be rewritten using modern JavaScript (ECMAScript Module syntax) as follows:

```javascript
// Re-export all exports from the 'jsSha256' module
export * from './jsSha256';
```

This rewritten code does the same as the original: it exports everything from the `jsSha256` module, but uses modern JavaScript syntax, which is more concise and aligned with the ECMAScript Module standard. The source map comment is omitted for brevity, as it's typically handled by build tools separately.

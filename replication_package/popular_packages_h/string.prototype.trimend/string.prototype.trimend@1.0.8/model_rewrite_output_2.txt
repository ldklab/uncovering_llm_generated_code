The functionality of this Node.js code is as follows:

1. **Import Dependencies**: The code begins by importing necessary modules:
   - `call-bind` is used to bind a function to a context.
   - `define-properties` is used to define properties on an object.
   - `RequireObjectCoercible` ensures that the value passed is not null or undefined, throwing a `TypeError` if it is.

2. **Internal Modules**: It imports three files that are part of the same project or package:
   - `./implementation`: Likely contains the main logic or method that needs to be polyfilled or shimmed.
   - `./polyfill`: Provides a polyfill implementation for environments that don't support a feature natively.
   - `./shim`: Contains additional logic/methods to extend or customize an environment with a particular feature.

3. **Binding and Coercion**:
   - The `getPolyfill()` function result is bound to `bound` using `callBind`.
   - A function `boundMethod` is defined to utilize `RequireObjectCoercible` to ensure the `receiver` is non-null before invoking the `bound` function.

4. **Define Properties**:
   - Properties `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` are defined on `boundMethod`, allowing it to expose these components.

5. **Export**:
   - Finally, `boundMethod` is exported, making it available for other modules to use.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code following the above explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Importing necessary modules
const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const RequireObjectCoercible = require('es-object-atoms/RequireObjectCoercible');

// Importing internal functionality
const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Creating a bound version of the polyfill
const bound = callBind(getPolyfill());

// Defining a method to invoke the bound function with coercion
const boundMethod = function (receiver) {
  RequireObjectCoercible(receiver);
  return bound(receiver);
};

// Defining additional properties on the boundMethod
defineProperties(boundMethod, {
  getPolyfill,
  implementation,
  shim
});

// Exporting the boundMethod for external usage
module.exports = boundMethod;
```

The provided Node.js code logs the relative path from the current working directory to the directory where the script is located. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `require('path')`: This imports the built-in Node.js `path` module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
2. `path.relative()`: This method is used to determine the relative path between two paths.
   - The first argument is the base path from which to calculate the relative path, in this case, `'.'`, which represents the current working directory.
   - The second argument is `__dirname`, a Node.js global variable that provides the absolute path to the directory containing the current script.
3. `console.log()`: This outputs the result to the console, displaying the relative path calculated by `path.relative()`.

In summary, the code calculates and outputs the relative file path from the current working directory to the directory where the script exists.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Calculate the relative path from the current working directory to the script's directory
const relativePath = path.relative(process.cwd(), __dirname);

// Log the relative path to the console
console.log(relativePath);
```

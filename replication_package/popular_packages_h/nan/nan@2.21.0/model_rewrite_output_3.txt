The given Node.js code logs the relative path from the current working directory to the directory name of the current script file. The `require('path').relative` function takes two arguments: the first is the base directory from which the relative path should be calculated (in this case, the current working directory `'.'`), and the second argument is the `__dirname`, which provides the directory name of the current module. The function computes the relative path between these two directories and logs it to the console.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Get the current working directory
const currentDir = process.cwd();

// Get the directory name of the current module
const scriptDir = __dirname;

// Calculate the relative path from the current working directory to the script directory
const relativePath = path.relative(currentDir, scriptDir);

// Log the relative path to the console
console.log(relativePath);
```

The provided Node.js code is using the `path` module, specifically the `relative` method, to print the relative path from the current working directory (denoted by `'.'`) to the directory of the currently executing script (denoted by `__dirname`). The `relative` method calculates the difference between two paths and returns the relative path from the first path to the second. This is helpful to dynamically determine how to navigate the directory structure relative to where the script is running.

Here's a rewritten version of the original Node.js code with additional explanation through comments:

```javascript
// Import the 'path' module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
const path = require('path');

// Get the directory name of the current module's file.
const currentDir = __dirname;

// Get the current working directory.
const currentWorkingDir = '.';

// Calculate the relative path from the current working directory to the directory of the script.
const relativePath = path.relative(currentWorkingDir, currentDir);

// Output the relative path between the two directories.
console.log(relativePath);
```

The given Node.js code is a simple script that outputs the relative path from the current directory (denoted by '.') to the directory where the script is located (denoted by `__dirname`). The `require('path').relative` function calculates the relative path between two paths. In this case, the function is calculating the relative path between the current working directory ('.') and the script's directory (`__dirname`). The result is then printed to the console using `console.log`.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Calculate the relative path from the current directory to the script's directory
const relativePath = path.relative(process.cwd(), __dirname);

// Output the relative path
console.log(relativePath);
```

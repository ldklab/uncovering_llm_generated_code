The Node.js code snippet provided is using the `path` module to determine the relative path from the current working directory (`'.'`) to the directory name where the current script is located (`__dirname`). The `require('path')` is used to include the built-in `path` module, and the `relative` method is called to compute this relative path. The result of this computation is then printed to the console using `console.log`.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Get the relative path from the current directory to the script's directory
const relativePath = path.relative(process.cwd(), __dirname);

// Output the relative path
console.log(relativePath);
```

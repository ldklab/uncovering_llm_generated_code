The given Node.js code snippet is using the `path` module to determine the relative path from the current working directory (which is represented by `'.'`) to the directory where the script is located (`__dirname`). It then outputs this relative path to the console using `console.log`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const currentDir = '.';
const scriptDir = __dirname;

const relativePath = path.relative(currentDir, scriptDir);

console.log(relativePath);
```

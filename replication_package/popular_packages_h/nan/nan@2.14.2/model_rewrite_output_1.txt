The given Node.js code outputs the relative path from the current working directory to the directory where the script is located. Here's how it works:

1. **`require('path')`**: This imports the built-in Node.js `path` module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

2. **`path.relative(from, to)`**: This function returns the relative path from the `from` directory to the `to` directory.

3. **`.`**: This represents the current working directory (typically where the script is executed from).

4. **`__dirname`**: This is a global variable in Node.js that contains the directory name of the current module (where the script is located).

The code computes the relative path between the directory where the script is run and the directory where the script is located, and then logs that path to the console.

Hereâ€™s a potential rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const currentWorkingDirectory = '.';
const scriptDirectory = __dirname;
const relativePath = path.relative(currentWorkingDirectory, scriptDirectory);
console.log(relativePath);
```

The Node.js code is a simple module that imports a module or functionality from a file located at './dist' and then exports it. This allows the imported functionalities to be reused or accessed from other files by importing this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const loader = require('./dist/index.js');

module.exports = loader;
```

In this rewrite, it is more explicit by suggesting that the specific file './dist/index.js' is being imported, assuming that './dist' is a directory and 'index.js' is the main file in that directory. This helps clarify the structure and intention if there is an index.js file, but functionally, it's the same if './dist' resolves to a file or a directory with an index.js file inside it.

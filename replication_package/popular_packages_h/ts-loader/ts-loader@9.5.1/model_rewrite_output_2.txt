The Node.js code provided imports a module named `loader` from the current directory's `dist` folder and then exports it. This means that any functionality or objects available in the `loader` module will be accessible to any other module that imports this file.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const loaderModule = require('./dist');

module.exports = loaderModule;
```

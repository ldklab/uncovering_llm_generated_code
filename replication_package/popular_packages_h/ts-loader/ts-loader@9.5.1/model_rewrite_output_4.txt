The given Node.js code imports a module named `loader` from a file located in the `dist` directory relative to the current file. It then exports this module, making it accessible to other files that import from this module. Essentially, this acts as a simple re-export of the imported module, serving as a bridge between the original file and wherever the exported module is used.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const loader = require('./dist');

module.exports = loader;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module re-exporter. It imports a module located at `./dist` and then re-exports it so that when other files import this file (the current file), they receive the exports from the `./dist` module. This is useful for organizing code and controlling module export paths in a project.

Hereâ€™s a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import the module located at './dist'
const loader = require('./dist');

// Export the imported module to be available for other files
module.exports = loader;
```

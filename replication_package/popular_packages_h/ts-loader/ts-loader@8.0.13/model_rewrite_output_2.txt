The given Node.js code imports a module located at `./dist` and immediately exports it. This essentially acts as a pass-through, where the module being imported is directly exposed to any other file that requires this module. 

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const loaderModule = require('./dist');

module.exports = loaderModule;
```

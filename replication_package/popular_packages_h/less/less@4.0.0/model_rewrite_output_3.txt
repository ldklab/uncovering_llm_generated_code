The provided Node.js code is a module export statement. It exports a default-exported member from another module located in the file `'./lib/less-node'`. This allows other files to import this default member when they require this module. The code uses the CommonJS module system for exporting and requires a specific file path to the module that needs to be exported.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const lessNode = require('./lib/less-node').default;
module.exports = lessNode;
```

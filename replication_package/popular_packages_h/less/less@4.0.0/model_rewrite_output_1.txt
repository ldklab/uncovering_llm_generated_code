The provided Node.js code is exporting a default module from another file. It uses CommonJS `module.exports` to export whatever is found as the `default` export from the module located at `'./lib/less-node'`. This pattern is commonly used to re-export modules or to organize code in a way that abstracts the true source of the module being exported. 

A possible ES6 style rewrite using `import` and `export` syntax would look like this:

```javascript
import lessNode from './lib/less-node';

export default lessNode;
```

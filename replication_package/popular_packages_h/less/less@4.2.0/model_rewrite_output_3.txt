The functionality of this Node.js code is to export a specific module that is required from another file. In this case, it imports the `default` export from a file located at `'./lib/less-node'` and then directly exports it as the module that can be used by other files that require this one. This pattern is typically used to create a central point of access to functionality defined in another module.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const lessNodeDefaultExport = require('./lib/less-node').default;

module.exports = lessNodeDefaultExport;
```

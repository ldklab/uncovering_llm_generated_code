The provided Node.js code exports the default export from a module located at `./lib/less-node`. It's essentially importing the default export from that module and making it available as the module's own export. This pattern is typically used when you want to simply re-export a single default export from another module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Import the default export from './lib/less-node'
const lessNodeDefault = require('./lib/less-node').default;

// Export it as the default export of this module
module.exports = lessNodeDefault;
```

The provided Node.js code exports the default export from a module located at `./lib/less-node`. The `require` function is used to import the module located at the specified path, and then the `.default` property of the imported module is exported as the module's export. This is typical when using Babel or similar tools, which transform ES6+ module syntax into CommonJS, leaving the main export on a `.default` property.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const lessNode = require('./lib/less-node');
module.exports = lessNode.default;
```

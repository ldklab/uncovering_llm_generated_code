The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to export the default export from the `./lib/less-node` module. Essentially, this line of code acts as a bridge, exposing whatever is exported as the default from `less-node` so that any module importing this file will receive that default export.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const lessNodeDefaultExport = require('./lib/less-node').default;

module.exports = lessNodeDefaultExport;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function. This function is used to merge two objects, `options` and `defaults`. The goal of the function is to ensure that all default values from the `defaults` object are present in the `options` object unless a value is already defined in `options`. The `clone` module is used to create deep copies of the default values to avoid unwanted mutations.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:
1. The `clone` library is imported to make deep copies of objects or values.
2. The exported function takes two parameters: `options` and `defaults`.
3. If `options` is not provided (i.e., it's `undefined`), it is initialized as an empty object.
4. The function iterates over each key in the `defaults` object.
5. For every key in `defaults`, it checks if `options` has a defined (non-`undefined`) value for that key.
6. If `options` does not have a defined value for the key, the key-value pair from `defaults` is deeply cloned and added to `options`.
7. Finally, the function returns the modified `options` object with defaults applied.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const cloneDeep = require('clone');

function mergeOptionsWithDefaults(options = {}, defaults) {
  Object.entries(defaults).forEach(([key, value]) => {
    if (options[key] === undefined) {
      options[key] = cloneDeep(value);
    }
  });
  return options;
}

module.exports = mergeOptionsWithDefaults;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that utilizes JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance and function binding capabilities to export a utility function. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its functionality:

1. **Strict Mode**: `'use strict';` makes the script execute in strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions like setting undeclared variables.

2. **Function Prototype Call Method**: The code references `Function.prototype.call`, which is a method that allows a function to be invoked with a specified `this` value and arguments provided as a sequence.

3. **Object Prototype Method `hasOwnProperty`**: The code references `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, a method used to determine whether an object has a particular property as its own (not inherited).

4. **`function-bind` Module**: The code requires an external module named `function-bind`, which allows functions to have their `this` context and initial arguments permanently associated with a particular object.

5. **Exported Function**: The module exports a function that is a bound version of `call` with the `this` context set to `hasOwnProperty` method. This binding effectively creates a version of `hasOwnProperty` that can be used generically on any object, i.e., it allows you to call `hasOwnProperty` on any object without relying on that objectâ€™s prototype chain.

Rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const bind = require('function-bind');

// Create a reference to the hasOwnProperty method of the Object prototype
const hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;

// Bind the call function to hasOwnProperty, allowing use as a standalone utility
module.exports = bind.call(Function.prototype.call, hasOwnProperty);
```

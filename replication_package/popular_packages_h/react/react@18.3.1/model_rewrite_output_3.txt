The given Node.js code is a module export logic that conditionally exports either the production build or the development build of the React library, depending on the environment. The script checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If it's set to 'production', it exports the minified production version of React. Otherwise, it exports the development version, which typically includes additional warnings and helpful error messages for debugging purposes.

Here's a rewritten version of the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = env === 'production';

module.exports = isProduction 
  ? require('./cjs/react.production.min.js') 
  : require('./cjs/react.development.js');
```

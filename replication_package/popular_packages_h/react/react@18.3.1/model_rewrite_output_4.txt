The provided Node.js code is a module that exports either a production or development version of a React library based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', the module exports the minified production version of the React library located at `./cjs/react.production.min.js`. Otherwise, it exports the development version located at `./cjs/react.development.js`. This approach helps in optimizing the application for different environments (development or production) by loading the appropriate version of React.

```javascript
'use strict';

let reactLibrary;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  reactLibrary = require('./cjs/react.production.min.js');
} else {
  reactLibrary = require('./cjs/react.development.js');
}

module.exports = reactLibrary;
```

The functionality of this Node.js code is to conditionally export a specific version of the React library based on the current environment. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine if the environment is set to 'production'. If it is, it exports the minified production build of React, which is optimized for efficiency and performance. Otherwise, it exports the development version of React, which includes additional warnings and debugging capabilities to aid in development.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const productionReact = './cjs/react.production.min.js';
const developmentReact = './cjs/react.development.js';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const reactPath = isProduction ? productionReact : developmentReact;

module.exports = require(reactPath);
```

The Node.js code provided is a conditional module export setup based on the environment in which the application is running. This is commonly found in JavaScript projects that use different builds of libraries for production and development environments. 

- It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, which is typically set to either 'production' or 'development'.
- If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', the code exports the optimized, minified version of the React library (`react.production.min.js`), which is suited for use in deployed applications because it's smaller in size and more efficient.
- Otherwise, for any other environment setting (usually 'development'), it exports the development version of the React library (`react.development.js`). This version includes helpful warnings for developers working on the application.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const path = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? './cjs/react.production.min.js'
  : './cjs/react.development.js';

module.exports = require(path);
```

The given Node.js code is a module export script that dynamically exports different files based on the environment in which the application is running. Specifically, it checks the `NODE_ENV` environmental variable to determine if the application is running in 'production' mode or not.

- If the `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports the minified production version of the React library from `./cjs/react.production.min.js`.
- If the `NODE_ENV` is not set to 'production' (implying it is in development mode), it exports the development version of React from `./cjs/react.development.js`.

This approach is generally used to ensure that the production environment benefits from optimizations like smaller file size, while the development environment benefits from better error messages and debugging capabilities.

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const reactPath = env === 'production' ? './cjs/react.production.min.js' : './cjs/react.development.js';

module.exports = require(reactPath);
```

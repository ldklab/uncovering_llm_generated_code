The given Node.js code is used to conditionally export different versions of the React library based on the environment in which the application is running. Specifically, it checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it loads and exports the minified production version of React from `./cjs/react.production.min.js`.
- Otherwise (typically when `NODE_ENV` is set to `'development'` or undefined), it loads and exports the development version of React from `./cjs/react.development.js`.

This pattern allows for optimized performance and reduced file size in production by using a minimized library version, while retaining detailed error messages and warnings in development through the full-featured version.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const reactPath = isProduction ? './cjs/react.production.min.js' : './cjs/react.development.js';

module.exports = require(reactPath);
```

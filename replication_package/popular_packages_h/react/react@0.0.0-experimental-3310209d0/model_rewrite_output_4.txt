The provided Node.js code is used to determine which build of the React library should be loaded based on the environment the application is running in. 

- It checks the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to see if it is set to `'production'`.
- If the environment is `'production'`, it exports the minified production build of React from the file `./cjs/react.production.min.js`.
- Otherwise, if the environment is not `'production'`, it exports the development build of React from the file `./cjs/react.development.js`.
  
This conditional export mechanism ensures that in a production environment, the optimized and minified version of React is used for performance, while in a development environment, the non-minified version is used, possibly with more helpful debugging capabilities.

Below is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const isProduction = environment === 'production';
const buildPath = isProduction ? './cjs/react.production.min.js' : './cjs/react.development.js';

module.exports = require(buildPath);
```

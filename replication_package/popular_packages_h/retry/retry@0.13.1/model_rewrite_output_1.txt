The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to export whatever is being exported from the module located at `./lib/retry`. When another module imports this file, it will actually receive the exports from `./lib/retry`. This is a common pattern for re-exporting a module or creating an alias for a specific module path in the project structure.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Loads and exports the module located at './lib/retry'.
// Any imports of this file will effectively import './lib/retry'.
const retryModule = require('./lib/retry');

module.exports = retryModule;
```

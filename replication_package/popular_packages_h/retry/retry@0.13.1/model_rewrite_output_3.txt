The provided Node.js code is a simple module that exports whatever is defined in another module located at `./lib/retry`. This means that any functions, classes, or other exported values from the `retry` module will be made available for use wherever this module is imported.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
// Export the content from the retry module found in the lib directory.
const retry = require('./lib/retry');

// Export the imported module so it can be used in other parts of the application
module.exports = retry;
```

The given Node.js code is a module export statement. It exports whatever is being exported from the `./lib/retry` module. The functionality of this code is simply to re-export whatever is defined in `./lib/retry` so it can be used elsewhere when this module is required.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const retry = require('./lib/retry');
module.exports = retry;
```

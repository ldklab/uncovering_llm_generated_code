The Node.js code you provided is a simple module export statement. It exports whatever is being exported from the module located at `'./lib/retry'`. This code is acting as a re-export mechanism, allowing other parts of the application to import from this file instead of directly accessing `'./lib/retry'`.

A rewritten version of this code could maintain the same functionality by ensuring that it exports from `'./lib/retry'`, providing the same re-export functionality. Here is how it might look:

```javascript
const retryModule = require('./lib/retry');
module.exports = retryModule;
```

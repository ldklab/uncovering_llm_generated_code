The given Node.js code exports a module from another file located at `./lib/retry`. This means the current module is essentially re-exporting the functionality provided by the `retry` module from the specified path. When another file imports this module, it will get whatever is exported by the `./lib/retry` module. This kind of re-export is often used to simplify import paths or to consolidate several sub-modules into a single module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const retryModule = require('./lib/retry');
module.exports = retryModule;
```

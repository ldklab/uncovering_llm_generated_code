The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports the content found in the file located at `'./lib/retry'`. This means that when another file imports this module, it will receive whatever is being exported from the `'./lib/retry'` file. Essentially, it acts as a proxy, re-exporting the contents from another file.

Here is a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
const retry = require('./lib/retry');
module.exports = retry;
```

In this rewritten code, the `retry` module from the `'./lib/retry'` path is first required and saved into a variable called `retry`. This variable is then exported as the module's output using `module.exports`. This rewrite makes it explicit that we're importing something into a variable and then exporting that variable.

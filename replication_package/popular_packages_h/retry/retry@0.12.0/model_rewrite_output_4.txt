The provided Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports the contents of another module located at `'./lib/retry'`. When this module is imported elsewhere, it provides access to the functionalities or objects defined in `'./lib/retry'`. This is a common pattern in Node.js for structuring or organizing code in separate files or directories, and then exporting them for use in other parts of the application.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
// Export the contents of the './lib/retry' module.
// This allows other files to require this module and use its functionality.
const retryModule = require('./lib/retry');

// Export the module so it can be used in other parts of the application
module.exports = retryModule;
```

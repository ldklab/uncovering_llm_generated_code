/**
 * This script essentially serves as an animation utility library built on top of React and other internal
 * mechanisms like WAAPI (Web Animations API), with added support for features like variants, drag, and layout,
 * among others. The code is structured to optimize animation performance and functionality within a React 
 * application context by creating utility functions, constants, and classes. 
 * 
 * Several helper functions and hooks are used to interact with reactive state, as well as manage animation
 * states and variants for various components. The script also addresses specific design patterns and UX 
 * optimization, for instance, using `reduce motion preference` to handle animations appropriately for users
 * who prefer reduced motion.
 * 
 * Moreover, the library provides various ways to construct and manage animations, including timeline building,
 * animation of individual or grouped DOM elements, etc., while giving developers the ability to fine-tune 
 * these animations according to specific needs.

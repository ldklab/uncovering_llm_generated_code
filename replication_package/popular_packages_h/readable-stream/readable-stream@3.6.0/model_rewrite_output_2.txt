The given Node.js code is a conditional module export setup for a custom stream implementation. It checks if a specific environment variable (`READABLE_STREAM`) is set to 'disable'. Depending on the result of this check, it either exports the default Node.js Stream module or custom stream implementations provided in separate files. The code also includes additional stream utilities such as `finished` and `pipeline`.

- If `process.env.READABLE_STREAM` is 'disable':
  - The code exports the Node.js built-in Stream.Readable as the main export.
  - It also assigns all properties of the Stream module to the export, and includes the Stream module itself as part of the exports.
  
- If `process.env.READABLE_STREAM` is not 'disable':
  - The code imports custom stream implementations from the specified files located in a `lib` directory.
  - These custom implementations are then assigned to the exports object.
  - The code exports custom classes and utilities for `Readable`, `Writable`, `Duplex`, `Transform`, `PassThrough`, `finished`, and `pipeline`.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const Stream = require('stream');
let exports;

if (process.env.READABLE_STREAM === 'disable' && Stream) {
  exports = Stream.Readable;
  Object.assign(exports, Stream);
  exports.Stream = Stream;
} else {
  const _stream_readable = require('./lib/_stream_readable.js');
  const _stream_writable = require('./lib/_stream_writable.js');
  const _stream_duplex = require('./lib/_stream_duplex.js');
  const _stream_transform = require('./lib/_stream_transform.js');
  const _stream_passthrough = require('./lib/_stream_passthrough.js');
  const _end_of_stream = require('./lib/internal/streams/end-of-stream.js');
  const _pipeline = require('./lib/internal/streams/pipeline.js');
  
  exports = _stream_readable;
  exports.Stream = Stream || _stream_readable;
  exports.Readable = _stream_readable;
  exports.Writable = _stream_writable;
  exports.Duplex = _stream_duplex;
  exports.Transform = _stream_transform;
  exports.PassThrough = _stream_passthrough;
  exports.finished = _end_of_stream;
  exports.pipeline = _pipeline;
}

module.exports = exports;
```

The provided Node.js code is designed to export certain stream functionalities based on whether a specific environment variable is set. The environment variable `READABLE_STREAM` determines whether to use the built-in Node.js Stream module or a custom stream implementation located in a relative path `../stream`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the functionality:

1. It first imports the native Stream module from Node.js.
2. It checks the existence of the Stream module and whether the `READABLE_STREAM` environment variable is set to `'disable'`.
3. If `READABLE_STREAM` is `'disable'`, it exports various utilities and classes from the native Stream module, including Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform, and others. It also maintains compatibility with promises by managing them via a `defineProperty`.
4. If `READABLE_STREAM` is not `'disable'`, it imports a custom stream module and its promises implementation. It then exports similar utilities and classes from this custom implementation, ensuring the original destroy method of the custom Readable stream is retained.
5. The exported functionalities are named explicitly to accommodate ECMAScript Modules (ESM).
6. It ensures the module can be default-imported by assigning the export object to `module.exports.default`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const Stream = require('stream');
let exportedStream = null;

if (Stream && process.env.READABLE_STREAM === 'disable') {
  // Using native Node.js Stream module
  exportedStream = {
    _uint8ArrayToBuffer: Stream._uint8ArrayToBuffer,
    _isUint8Array: Stream._isUint8Array,
    isDisturbed: Stream.isDisturbed,
    isErrored: Stream.isErrored,
    isReadable: Stream.isReadable,
    Readable: Stream.Readable,
    Writable: Stream.Writable,
    Duplex: Stream.Duplex,
    Transform: Stream.Transform,
    PassThrough: Stream.PassThrough,
    addAbortSignal: Stream.addAbortSignal,
    finished: Stream.finished,
    destroy: Stream.destroy,
    pipeline: Stream.pipeline,
    compose: Stream.compose,
    Stream: Stream.Stream,
    default: null, // Assigned at the end
  };
  
  // Managing promises
  const promises = Stream.promises;
  Object.defineProperty(Stream, 'promises', {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    get() {
      return promises;
    }
  });

} else {
  // Using custom stream implementation
  const CustomStream = require('../stream');
  const promises = require('../stream/promises');
  
  exportedStream = Object.assign(CustomStream.Readable, {
    _uint8ArrayToBuffer: CustomStream._uint8ArrayToBuffer,
    _isUint8Array: CustomStream._isUint8Array,
    isDisturbed: CustomStream.isDisturbed,
    isErrored: CustomStream.isErrored,
    isReadable: CustomStream.isReadable,
    Readable: CustomStream.Readable,
    Writable: CustomStream.Writable,
    Duplex: CustomStream.Duplex,
    Transform: CustomStream.Transform,
    PassThrough: CustomStream.PassThrough,
    addAbortSignal: CustomStream.addAbortSignal,
    finished: CustomStream.finished,
    destroy: CustomStream.Readable.destroy,
    pipeline: CustomStream.pipeline,
    compose: CustomStream.compose,
    Stream: CustomStream.Stream,
    default: null, // Assigned at the end
  });
  
  // Managing promises
  Object.defineProperty(CustomStream, 'promises', {
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    get() {
      return promises;
    }
  });
}

// Assign default export to allow default importing
exportedStream.default = exportedStream;
module.exports = exportedStream;

The Node.js code provided is a module that sets up a polyfill for a certain functionality. It organizes the polyfill setup by:

1. Using the `define-properties` library to define non-enumerable properties.
2. Using `call-bind` to bind the polyfill function to the `Object` context.
3. Importing three local modules:
   - `implementation` which likely contains the core implementation of the feature or function being polyfilled.
   - `getPolyfill` which probably returns the polyfill if needed.
   - `shim` which might integrate the polyfill with the existing environment if the native method doesn't exist.
4. Creating a `polyfill` function by binding the polyfill returned by `getPolyfill()` to `Object`.
5. Defining three properties (`getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`) on the `polyfill` function, associating them with their respective modules, while ensuring they are non-enumerable using `define-properties`.
6. Exporting the `polyfill` function as the module's public API.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const bindFunction = require('call-bind');

const implementationFunction = require('./implementation');
const fetchPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const applyShim = require('./shim');

const polyfillFunction = bindFunction(fetchPolyfill(), Object);

defineProperties(polyfillFunction, {
    getPolyfill: fetchPolyfill,
    implementation: implementationFunction,
    shim: applyShim
});

module.exports = polyfillFunction;
```

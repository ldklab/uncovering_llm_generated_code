The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a "polyfill" function with additional properties. This function is generated using the `call-bind` module and applies to the `Object` type. Here is a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The script begins by importing several modules:
   - `define-properties`: Used to define properties on an object.
   - `call-bind`: Utilized to create a function that invokes the `getPolyfill` method with `Object` as its context.
   - Local modules: `./implementation`, `./polyfill`, and `./shim` which represent internal logic and support functions specific to this polyfill implementation.

2. A `polyfill` function is created by invoking the `getPolyfill` function and binding its context to `Object`.

3. Using `define`, three properties are added to the `polyfill` function:
   - `getPolyfill`: A reference to the `getPolyfill` function.
   - `implementation`: A reference to the actual implementation of the functionality this polyfill supports.
   - `shim`: A mechanism likely provided to install or configure the polyfill within a broader context.

4. Finally, the `polyfill` function with its additional properties is exported as the module's public API.

Here is the possible rewrite of this Node.js code based on the explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementationFunction = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfillFunction = require('./polyfill');
const shimFunction = require('./shim');

const polyfillFunction = callBind(getPolyfillFunction(), Object);

defineProperties(polyfillFunction, {
	getPolyfill: getPolyfillFunction,
	implementation: implementationFunction,
	shim: shimFunction
});

module.exports = polyfillFunction;
```

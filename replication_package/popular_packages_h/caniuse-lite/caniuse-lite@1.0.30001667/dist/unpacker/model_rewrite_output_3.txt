The Node.js code provided is exporting modules and their properties. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

1. `module.exports.agents = require('./agents').agents`: This line exports the `agents` property from the module located in `'./agents'`. This allows other files to access `agents` when they import this module.

2. `module.exports.feature = require('./feature')`: This line exports everything from the `'./feature'` module. Anything exported from `'./feature'` can now be accessed through `feature` in other files.

3. `module.exports.features = require('./features').features`: Similar to the first line, this exports the `features` property from the `'./features'` module. This enables access to `features` in other files.

4. `module.exports.region = require('./region')`: This line exports everything from the `'./region'` module. Once again, this allows any exports from `'./region'` to be accessed through `region` in other files.

A possible rewrite of this Node.js code could be:

```javascript
const { agents } = require('./agents');
const feature = require('./feature');
const { features } = require('./features');
const region = require('./region');

module.exports = {
  agents,
  feature,
  features,
  region,
};
```

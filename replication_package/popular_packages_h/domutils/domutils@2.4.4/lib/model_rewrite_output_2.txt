The provided Node.js code is designed to re-export modules from several files. It defines a utility function `__createBinding`, which is used to establish a property on an object that refers to a module's exported member. Another utility function, `__exportStar`, leverages this capability to re-export all exports from a given module, excluding the default export. The code then applies `__exportStar` to re-export all exports from the modules `stringify`, `traversal`, `manipulation`, `querying`, `legacy`, `helpers`, and `tagtypes`. This kind of setup is common in index files to consolidate and simplify imports for the rest of the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code using modern JavaScript (ES Module) syntax which doesn't require custom binding functions:

```javascript
// Consolidate and re-export module exports
export * from './stringify';
export * from './traversal';
export * from './manipulation';
export * from './querying';
export * from './legacy';
export * from './helpers';
export * from './tagtypes';
```

The code is a Node.js module that exports functionalities from multiple modules. It uses two polyfills `__createBinding` and `__exportStar` to ensure compatibility across different JavaScript environments. These functions handle the exporting process, ensuring that all exports from specified modules are added to the current module's exports, except for the default export. The code exports functionality from seven different modules: `stringify`, `traversal`, `manipulation`, `querying`, `legacy`, `helpers`, and `tagtypes`.

Here's the rewritten code without unnecessary polyfill logic:

```javascript
"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

export * from "./stringify";
export * from "./traversal";
export * from "./manipulation";
export * from "./querying";
export * from "./legacy";
export * from "./helpers";
export * from "./tagtypes";
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that is part of a larger project by Yahoo Inc. The primary functionality of this code is to export an object with a single method, `createSourceMapStore`. This method can be used to create and return a new instance of the `MapStore` class, which is obtained by requiring the './lib/map-store' module. The `MapStore` class likely deals with source map functionality, given its name. The module follows strict mode by using `'use strict';` for better error-checking and to prevent the use of potentially problematic JavaScript features.

Here's the rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript

'use strict';

const { MapStore } = require('./lib/map-store');

module.exports = {
    createSourceMapStore(options) {
        return new MapStore(options);
    }
};
```

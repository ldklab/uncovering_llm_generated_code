The given Node.js code defines a module that provides utilities to parse and stringify JSON5 data. JSON5 is a JSON extension that allows for more expressive syntax, including comments and less strict formatting such as unquoted keys.

Here's a breakdown of the code functionality:
1. It imports two functions, `parse` and `stringify`, from two separate modules located in the same directory.
2. It creates an object `JSON5` that contains these two functions.
3. It exports the `JSON5` object as a module, making the `parse` and `stringify` functions accessible when the module is imported elsewhere.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code according to this explanation:

```javascript
const parseFunction = require('./parse');
const stringifyFunction = require('./stringify');

const JSON5Utilities = {
    parse: parseFunction,
    stringify: stringifyFunction
};

module.exports = JSON5Utilities;
```

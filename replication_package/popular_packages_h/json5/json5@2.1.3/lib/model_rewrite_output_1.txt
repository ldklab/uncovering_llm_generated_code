The given Node.js code defines a module for working with JSON5 data. JSON5 is an extension of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) that aims to make it easier to write and maintain by allowing additional syntax features. The code imports two functionalities, `parse` and `stringify`, from their respective modules or files. These functions are then aggregated into an object called `JSON5`. Finally, the `JSON5` object is exported as a module so that other parts of an application can use these features for parsing JSON5 strings into JavaScript objects and stringifying JavaScript objects into JSON5 format.

Here's the rewritten Node.js code:

```javascript
const parse = require('./parse');
const stringify = require('./stringify');

const JSON5 = {
    parse: parse,
    stringify: stringify,
};

module.exports = JSON5;
```

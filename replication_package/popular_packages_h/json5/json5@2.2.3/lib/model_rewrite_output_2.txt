The Node.js code defines a module that works with JSON5, an extension of JSON that allows for more relaxed parsing (e.g., allowing comments and trailing commas). It does this by importing two functionalities from external files or modules named 'parse' and 'stringify' located in the same directory. These functions handle parsing and stringifying of JSON5 respectively. The code then combines these two functionalities into a single `JSON5` object with properties `parse` and `stringify`. Finally, it exports the `JSON5` object, making it available for use in other files or modules.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const parse = require('./parse');
const stringify = require('./stringify');

class JSON5 {
    static parse(...args) {
        return parse(...args);
    }

    static stringify(...args) {
        return stringify(...args);
    }
}

module.exports = JSON5;
```

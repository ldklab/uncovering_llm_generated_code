The provided Node.js code snippet is a module definition for a package. It exports an object that has a `configs` property. This `configs` property further contains two properties, `all` and `recommended`. Both these properties are set to the configurations imported via `require()` from two separate files, `eslint-all` and `eslint-recommended`, which are located in a `configs` directory within the package. This setup is likely used to expose different ESLint configuration presets that can be accessed by other parts of the application or by developers using this package.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
/**
 * @fileoverview Main package entrypoint.
 * @author Nicholas C.
 */

"use strict";

// Exporting available ESLint configurations
module.exports = {
    // Configuration presets
    configs: {
        // Complete set of ESLint rules
        all: require("./configs/eslint-all"),
        // Recommended ESLint rules for most projects
        recommended: require("./configs/eslint-recommended")
    }
};
```

The provided Node.js code exports an object as the module's public interface. This object contains a single property `configs`, which is an object itself with two properties: `all` and `recommended`. These properties are likely configurations for a tool, possibly ESLint, given their names. The `all` and `recommended` properties are linked to required modules/files located at `./configs/eslint-all` and `./configs/eslint-recommended`, respectively. This pattern is often used in configuration packages to provide users with different sets of rules or settings.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Export an object containing ESLint configuration settings
module.exports = {
    // The configs property holds different ESLint configuration sets
    configs: {
        // 'all' configuration set, imported from the eslint-all file
        all: require("./configs/eslint-all"),
        
        // 'recommended' configuration set, imported from the eslint-recommended file
        recommended: require("./configs/eslint-recommended")
    }
};
```

The Node.js code is designed to define a module that exports a function. It first checks if the native `bind` method is available on `Function.prototype`. If `bind` is available, it exports the native method. If not, it exports a custom implementation of the `bind` method from a separate module found in the `implementation` file. This is useful for ensuring that the `bind` method can be used in environments where it might not be natively available.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const implementation = require('./implementation');

module.exports = typeof Function.prototype.bind === 'function' ? Function.prototype.bind : implementation;
```

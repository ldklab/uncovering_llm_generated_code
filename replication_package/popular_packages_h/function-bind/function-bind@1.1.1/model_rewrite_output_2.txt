The Node.js code is designed to export a polyfill for the `Function.prototype.bind` method. It first attempts to use the native `bind` method provided by the JavaScript engine. If that method is not available (which would be the case in very old JavaScript environments), it exports an alternative implementation provided in the `implementation` module.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const customBindImplementation = require('./implementation');

// Export the native bind method if available, otherwise fallback to custom implementation
module.exports = Function.prototype.bind ? Function.prototype.bind : customBindImplementation;
```

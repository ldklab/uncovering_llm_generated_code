The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export a binding function. It attempts to export the native `Function.prototype.bind` method if it exists (which is available in ECMAScript 5 and later). If the native `bind` method does not exist (which would be the case in older JavaScript environments), it exports a custom implementation of the `bind` function provided by the `implementation` module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const implementation = require('./implementation');

module.exports = typeof Function.prototype.bind === 'function' 
  ? Function.prototype.bind 
  : implementation;
```

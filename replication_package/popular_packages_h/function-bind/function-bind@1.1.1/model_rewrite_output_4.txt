The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function. It first tries to use the native `bind` method from `Function.prototype.bind`. If the native `bind` method is not available (which is unlikely in modern JavaScript environments), it falls back to a custom implementation found in the `./implementation` module. This is useful for ensuring compatibility with older environments that may not support `Function.prototype.bind`.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the custom bind implementation from the './implementation' file
const customBindImplementation = require('./implementation');

// Export the native Function.prototype.bind if it exists, otherwise fall back to the custom implementation
module.exports = Function.prototype.bind || customBindImplementation;
```

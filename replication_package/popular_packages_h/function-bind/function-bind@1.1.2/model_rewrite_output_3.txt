The Node.js code above is providing a module that exports a function. This function is determined by the availability of the `bind` method on `Function.prototype`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. It uses `'use strict';` to enforce strict mode, which helps in writing secure JavaScript by throwing more exceptions and disabling some features that are prone to errors.

2. It imports another module or file called `./implementation` and assigns it to a variable named `implementation`.

3. It checks if `Function.prototype.bind` is available (a standard method in JavaScript that creates a new function with the same body and scope but with a specified `this` value and initial arguments).

4. If `Function.prototype.bind` is available, it exports that; otherwise, it exports whatever is contained in the `implementation` variable, which presumably contains a polyfill or custom implementation for the `bind` functionality.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code following the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const customBind = require('./implementation');

module.exports = (typeof Function.prototype.bind === 'function') ? Function.prototype.bind : customBind;
```

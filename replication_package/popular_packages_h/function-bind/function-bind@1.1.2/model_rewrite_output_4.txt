The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function, which attempts to use the native `bind` method from the `Function.prototype`. If the native `bind` function is not available (which might be the case in older JavaScript environments that don't support this function), it falls back to use a custom implementation. The custom implementation is imported from a local module named `./implementation`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const implementation = require('./implementation');

module.exports = typeof Function.prototype.bind === 'function' ? Function.prototype.bind : implementation;
```

The code is a Node.js module that exports a function. It checks if the environment's `Function.prototype.bind` method is natively supported. If `Function.prototype.bind` is available (i.e., a non-falsy value), it exports that; otherwise, it exports a custom implementation from a file named 'implementation'. This is a typical pattern to use a native feature if available, while providing a fallback if it's not.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const customBind = require('./implementation');

module.exports = Function.prototype.bind ?? customBind;
```

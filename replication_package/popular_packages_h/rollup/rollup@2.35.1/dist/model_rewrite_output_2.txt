The provided Node.js code is a module that exports certain functionalities from a Rollup.js package. It imports a `rollup` module from a local file `'./shared/rollup.js'` and makes use of Node.js core modules like `fs`, `path`, `crypto`, and `events`, although they aren't directly used in the snippet.

Here is a brief explanation of each part of the code:

1. `Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true });` is used for compatibility, setting the module as an ES module.
2. `rollup` is imported from a relative path `./shared/rollup.js`, representing local Rollup.js functionality.
3. The code exports the `VERSION`, `rollup`, and `watch` properties of the `rollup` module.
4. The source map comment at the end (`//# sourceMappingURL=rollup.js.map`) is linked to a source map, which is useful for debugging minified/compiled code.

Below is a rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = (() => {
  const rollup = require('./shared/rollup.js');
  const fs = require('fs');
  const path = require('path');
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const events = require('events');

  return {
    VERSION: rollup.version,
    rollup: rollup.rollup,
    watch: rollup.watch,
  };
})();

//# sourceMappingURL=rollup.js.map
```

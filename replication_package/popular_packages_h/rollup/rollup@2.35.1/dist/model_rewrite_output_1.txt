The provided Node.js code is a module that exports certain functionalities from the Rollup.js library. This code is leveraging JavaScript's `require` and `exports` to import and re-export specific utilities from another module file (`./shared/rollup.js`). The re-exported functionalities include the `version`, `rollup`, and `watch` properties of Rollup. Additionally, it ensures the `exports` object is marked with `__esModule` to indicate it's an ES module. It's structured to include versioning information, licensing, and source mapping for development purposes.

Here is the rewritten code:

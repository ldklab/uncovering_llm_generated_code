The original Node.js code is a module aggregation and re-exporting script designed to gather and export modules from various files. It imports and re-exports all the exports from each specified module, making them accessible from a single entry point. This pattern is often used in modular programming to create a centralized API, reducing the need for repeated import statements throughout an application. The script uses the `tslib` package to facilitate these operations.

Here is a rewritten version of the code using more straightforward ES6 module syntax without the need for `tslib`:

```js
"use strict";
export * from "./abort";
export * from "./client";
export * from "./command";
export * from "./credentials";
export * from "./crypto";
export * from "./eventStream";
export * from "./http";
export * from "./logger";
export * from "./pagination";
export * from "./serde";
export * from "./middleware";
export * from "./response";
export * from "./signature";
export * from "./transfer";
export * from "./util";
```

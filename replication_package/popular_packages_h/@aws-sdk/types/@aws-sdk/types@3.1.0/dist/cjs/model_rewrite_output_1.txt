The provided Node.js code exports all the modules from different files located in the same directory. It uses the `tslib` library to achieve this, which provides helper functions to support various TypeScript functionalities in JavaScript. Each line of the code calls the `__exportStar` function from `tslib`, which re-exports all exports from the specified module/file.

Here's a possible rewrite that achieves the same functionality using standard ES6 module syntax without relying on `tslib`:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

export * from './abort';
export * from './client';
export * from './command';
export * from './credentials';
export * from './crypto';
export * from './eventStream';
export * from './http';
export * from './logger';
export * from './pagination';
export * from './serde';
export * from './middleware';
export * from './response';
export * from './signature';
export * from './transfer';
export * from './util';
```

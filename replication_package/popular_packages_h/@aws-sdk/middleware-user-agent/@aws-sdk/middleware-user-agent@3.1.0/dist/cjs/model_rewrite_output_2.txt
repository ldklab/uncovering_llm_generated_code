The given Node.js code is utilizing TypeScript and the `tslib` package to re-export all exports from two different modules: `configurations` and `user-agent-middleware`. The code is leveraging the `__exportStar` function provided by `tslib` to facilitate this re-exportation, which means that all exports from `./configurations` and `./user-agent-middleware` are being re-exported from the current module using CommonJS module syntax.

A potential rewrite of this code using modern JavaScript features without relying on `tslib` might look like this:

```javascript
"use strict";

export * from "./configurations";
export * from "./user-agent-middleware";

//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJmaWxlIjoiaW5kZXguanMiLCJzb3VyY2VSb290IjoiIiwic291cmNlcyI6WyIuLi8uLi9zcmMvaW5kZXgudHMiXSwibmFtZXMiOltdLCJtYXBwaW5ncyI6Ijs7O0FBQUEsMkRBQWlDO0FBQ2pDLGtFQUF3QyIsInNvdXJjZXNDb250ZW50IjpbImV4cG9ydCAqIGZyb20gXCIuL2NvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb25zXCI7XG5leHBvcnQgKiBmcm9tIFwiLi91c2VyLWFnZW50LW1pZGRsZXdhcmVcIjtcbiJdfQ==
```

In this rewritten version, we are directly using ES6 module syntax for the re-exportation, gaining readability and leveraging the native module capabilities available in modern JavaScript environments. This also removes the need for `tslib` if the only purpose of its inclusion was to facilitate module exports. However, the source map comment should be left unchanged as it pertains to the original TypeScript compilation configuration.

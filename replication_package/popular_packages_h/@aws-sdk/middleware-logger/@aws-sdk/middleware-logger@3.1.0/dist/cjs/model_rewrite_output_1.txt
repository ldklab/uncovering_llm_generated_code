The given Node.js code is a module that re-exports all exports from a file located at "./loggerMiddleware". The code uses TypeScript features and tooling from "tslib" for handling ES module import/export syntax in a manner compatible with various module systems. This is typically part of a larger TypeScript project. The code also includes a source map comment which appears to be pointing to its origin in the TypeScript source files.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original functionality using fewer dependency-specific functions:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

// Re-export everything from the 'loggerMiddleware' module
const loggerMiddleware = require("./loggerMiddleware");
Object.keys(loggerMiddleware).forEach(key => {
    if (key !== "default" && key !== "__esModule") {
        exports[key] = loggerMiddleware[key];
    }
});
```

This rewritten version uses standard Node.js require syntax for module resolution and a vanilla JavaScript loop to copy over exports, avoiding the use of the "tslib" library.

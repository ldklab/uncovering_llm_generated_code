The given Node.js code is part of an ES module system, specifically exporting parts of an Amazon S3 client library. It utilizes the `tslib` package's `__exportStar` function to re-export everything from multiple modules, making them available in the current module. This way of exporting provides a convenient mechanism for aggregators to collect all individual exports from smaller modules and re-export them from a central point (an index file). 

The code incorporates various command and configuration files associated with AWS S3 service, ranging from basic bucket and object operations to multipart uploads and bucket configurations. The imported modules include client files, S3 operations, bucket lifecycle and policy commands, object manipulation commands, pagination helpers, and model definitions.

The rewritten code in ES6 modules without using `tslib` would be:

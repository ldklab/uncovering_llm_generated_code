The provided Node.js code is a module that re-exports the exports from three other modules located in subdirectories. It uses the `tslib` package to handle the re-exporting of multiple modules, which can help streamline the requirement to potentially manage and distribute TypeScript compiled code. The code first ensures strict mode execution for cleaner and more error-checked JavaScript. Next, it imports the `tslib` library and uses the `__exportStar` function from `tslib` to re-export everything from the following module paths, making them accessible to other modules that import this one: 

1. `./submodules/client/index`
2. `./submodules/httpAuthSchemes/index`
3. `./submodules/protocols/index`

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports = {
    ...require("./submodules/client/index"),
    ...require("./submodules/httpAuthSchemes/index"),
    ...require("./submodules/protocols/index")
};
```

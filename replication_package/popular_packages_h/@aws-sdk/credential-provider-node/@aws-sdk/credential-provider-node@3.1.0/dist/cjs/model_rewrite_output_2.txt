The Node.js code provided primarily serves as a default credential provider for applications using AWS SDK. Its main function (`defaultProvider`) creates a chain of credential providers that it queries in a specific order of precedence to obtain AWS credentials. The order of precedence is as follows:

1. **Environment Variables**: The highest priority source is environment variables, like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

2. **Shared Credentials and Config INI Files**: If credentials are not found in environment variables, the provider looks for them in shared credentials files usually located at `~/.aws/credentials` and configuration files at `~/.aws/config`.

3. **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)**: If credentials are not found in the previous sources, the provider attempts to get credentials from the EC2/ECS Instance Metadata Service. This part can be disabled by setting the `AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED` environment variable to true.

4. **Process Credentials**: It can also retrieve credentials via a process defined in an INI configuration file.

The code utilizes the memoization technique to cache credentials and checks if they need to be refreshed based on their expiration time. If remote credentials (from container metadata) are enabled through environment variables, it also queries those.

Here's a tidy rewrite of the original code based on its functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";
import { 
  fromEnv 
} from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-env";
import { 
  ENV_CMDS_FULL_URI, 
  ENV_CMDS_RELATIVE_URI, 
  fromContainerMetadata, 
  fromInstanceMetadata, 
  RemoteProviderInit 
} from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-imds";
import { 
  ENV_PROFILE, 
  fromIni, 
  FromIniInit 
} from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-ini";
import {
  fromProcess, 
  FromProcessInit 
} from "@aws-sdk/credential-provider-process";
import { chain, memoize, ProviderError } from "@aws-sdk/property-provider";
import { CredentialProvider } from "@aws-sdk/types";

export const ENV_IMDS_DISABLED = "AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED";

/**
 * Default credential provider, sourcing credentials from environment variables,
 * INI files, instance metadata, or process execution.
 *
 * @param init Configuration for providers.
 */
export function defaultProvider(
  init: FromIniInit & RemoteProviderInit & FromProcessInit = {}
): CredentialProvider {
  const { profile = process.env[ENV_PROFILE] } = init;
  const providerChain = profile
    ? chain(fromIni(init), fromProcess(init))
    : chain(fromEnv(), fromIni(init), fromProcess(init), remoteProvider(init));

  return memoize(
    providerChain,
    (credentials) =>
      credentials.expiration !== undefined &&
      credentials.expiration.getTime() - Date.now() < 300000,
    (credentials) => credentials.expiration !== undefined
  );
}

function remoteProvider(init: RemoteProviderInit): CredentialProvider {
  if (process.env[ENV_CMDS_RELATIVE_URI] || process.env[ENV_CMDS_FULL_URI]) {
    return fromContainerMetadata(init);
  }

  if (process.env[ENV_IMDS_DISABLED]) {
    return () =>
      Promise.reject(
        new ProviderError("EC2 Instance Metadata Service access disabled")
      );
  }

  return fromInstanceMetadata(init);
}
```

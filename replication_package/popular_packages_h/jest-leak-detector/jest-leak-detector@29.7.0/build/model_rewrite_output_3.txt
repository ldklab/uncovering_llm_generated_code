The provided Node.js code defines a `LeakDetector` class designed to identify memory leaks by monitoring if objects are still being held in memory. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- It requires several modules, including `util`, `v8`, `vm`, `jest-get-type`, and `pretty-format`, which are essential for its operation.
- The `LeakDetector` class includes:
  - A constructor that takes a `value` and checks if it is a primitive. If it is, an error is thrown as primitives cannot leak memory.
  - A `_finalizationRegistry` is created using JavaScript's `FinalizationRegistry` to register the object (`value`) for monitoring. If the object is garbage collected, a callback sets `_isReferenceBeingHeld` to `false`.
  - The property `_isReferenceBeingHeld` keeps track of whether the object is still referenced in memory.
  - The method `isLeaking` runs the garbage collector and waits asynchronously, through `setImmediate`, for up to 10 ticks to allow the garbage collector to complete its work. It then returns whether the object is still held in memory (`_isReferenceBeingHeld`).
  - The private method `_runGarbageCollector` attempts to explicitly expose and run the garbage collector if it is hidden, making use of Node.jsâ€™s `v8` and `vm` modules.

Here is a rewritten version of the code with the explained functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const util = require('util');
const v8 = require('v8');
const vm = require('vm');
const { isPrimitive } = require('jest-get-type');
const { format } = require('pretty-format');

exports.default = class LeakDetector {
  constructor(value) {
    if (isPrimitive(value)) {
      throw new TypeError(
        `Primitives cannot leak memory. You passed a ${typeof value}: <${format(value)}>`
      );
    }

    this._isReferenceBeingHeld = true;

    this._finalizationRegistry = new FinalizationRegistry(() => {
      this._isReferenceBeingHeld = false;
    });
    
    this._finalizationRegistry.register(value, undefined);
    value = null; // Ensure no closure holds a reference
  }

  async isLeaking() {
    this._runGarbageCollector();

    const tick = util.promisify(setImmediate);
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      await tick();
    }
    
    return this._isReferenceBeingHeld;
  }

  _runGarbageCollector() {
    const gcWasHidden = !globalThis.gc;
    
    v8.setFlagsFromString('--expose-gc');
    vm.runInNewContext('gc')();

    if (gcWasHidden) {
      v8.setFlagsFromString('--no-expose-gc');
    }
  }
};
```

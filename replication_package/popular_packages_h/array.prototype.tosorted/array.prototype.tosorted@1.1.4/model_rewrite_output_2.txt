The provided Node.js code is a module that sets up and exports a bound function with some additional properties. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code uses `require` to import several dependencies: `define-properties`, `call-bind`, and three modules: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`.
2. It retrieves a polyfill function using `getPolyfill()`, which is presumably a module that returns a method used to ensure functionality in environments that do not natively support it.
3. `callBind` is used to create a bound version of this polyfill function. Binding a function generally fixes its `this` context, and `callBind` is a utility for creating such bound functions.
4. `define-properties` is used to attach additional properties to the bound function. Specifically, it adds `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` as properties of the resulting function.
5. Finally, the code exports the bound function, complete with its added properties, as the module's default export.

Here is the rewritten code according to the explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const define = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const polyfill = getPolyfill();
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundFunction = callBind(polyfill);

define(boundFunction, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundFunction;
```

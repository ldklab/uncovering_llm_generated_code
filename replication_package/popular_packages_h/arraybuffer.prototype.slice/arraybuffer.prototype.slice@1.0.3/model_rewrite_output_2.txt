The given Node.js code defines a module that prepares a bound version of a polyfill function and exports it with additional properties. The essential components are:

1. **Dependencies**: It requires several modules:
   - `define-properties`: Used to define properties on an object.
   - `call-bind`: A utility for binding functions.
   - Local modules likely located in the same directory: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`.

2. **Functionality**:
   - `implementation`: Contains the actual implementation of some functionality that might need polyfilling.
   - `getPolyfill`: Function presumably returns the polyfill for the above functionality.
   - `shim`: Probably applies the polyfill to the global environment.
   
3. **Process**:
   - Binds the polyfill function using `callBind` and stores it in `bound`.
   - Defines additional properties (`getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`) on the `bound` object.
   - Exports the `bound` object as a module, making these methods and properties available to other modules.

Here's a rewritten version of the code following the explained functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Create a bound version of the polyfill function
const boundPolyfill = callBind(getPolyfill());

// Define additional properties on the bound polyfill
defineProperties(boundPolyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

// Export the bound polyfill along with its properties
module.exports = boundPolyfill;
```

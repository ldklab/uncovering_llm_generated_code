The functionality of the given Node.js code is to determine which version of the Vue Router module should be exported based on the environment. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the production version of the Vue Router module, located at `./dist/vue-router.prod.cjs`.
- If `NODE_ENV` is not set to `'production'` (which could mean it's set to `'development'` or any other value), it exports the non-production (development) version, located at `./dist/vue-router.cjs`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const vueRouterPath = isProduction ? './dist/vue-router.prod.cjs' : './dist/vue-router.cjs';

module.exports = require(vueRouterPath);
```

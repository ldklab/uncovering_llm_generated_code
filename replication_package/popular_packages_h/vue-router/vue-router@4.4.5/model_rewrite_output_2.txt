The given Node.js code is a conditional module export for a package, likely intended for use with `vue-router`. The module to export is selected based on the current environment.

- If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'production'`, it exports the production version of the module located at `'./dist/vue-router.prod.cjs'`.
- If `NODE_ENV` is not `'production'`, it defaults to exporting the standard or development version from `'./dist/vue-router.cjs'`.

This pattern is typically used to conditionally load different versions of a library optimized for either development or production use.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProductionEnvironment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const pathToModule = isProductionEnvironment
  ? './dist/vue-router.prod.cjs'
  : './dist/vue-router.cjs';

module.exports = require(pathToModule);
```

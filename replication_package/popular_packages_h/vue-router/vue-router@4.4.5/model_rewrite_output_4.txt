The code is a conditional module export designed for a Node.js environment to load either a production or a development version of a specific file, based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
2. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the module located at `'./dist/vue-router.prod.cjs'`.
3. If `NODE_ENV` is not `'production'`, it defaults to exporting the module located at `'./dist/vue-router.cjs'`.

This pattern is often used to optimize applications, as production builds typically have optimizations like minification, which are not present in development builds.

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const prodFile = './dist/vue-router.prod.cjs';
const devFile = './dist/vue-router.cjs';
const fileToExport = (env === 'production') ? prodFile : devFile;

module.exports = require(fileToExport);
```

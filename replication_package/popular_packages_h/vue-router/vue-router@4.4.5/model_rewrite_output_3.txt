The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to export a different version of the `vue-router` module based on the environment in which the code is running. Specifically, it checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a production environment. If the `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, the code will export the production-optimized version of the `vue-router`, which is likely to be optimized for performance and have features suitable for deployment (typically found at `./dist/vue-router.prod.cjs`). Otherwise, it assumes a development or other type of environment and exports the standard, possibly more verbose version of the `vue-router` (found at `./dist/vue-router.cjs`), which may include additional features, checks, or debugging aids useful during development.

Here is a possible rewrite:

```javascript
'use strict'

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;

const vueRouterModule = environment === 'production' ? 
  './dist/vue-router.prod.cjs' : 
  './dist/vue-router.cjs';

module.exports = require(vueRouterModule);
```

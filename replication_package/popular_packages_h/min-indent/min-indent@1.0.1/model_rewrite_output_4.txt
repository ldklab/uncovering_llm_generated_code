The Node.js code provided is a module that exports a function. This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is expected to be a multiline string. The function calculates the minimum indentation (number of leading whitespace characters) of any non-empty line across the entire string.

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Regular Expression Matching**:
   - The function uses a regular expression `/^[ \t]*(?=\S)/gm` to find lines in the input string. 
   - `^[ \t]*` matches any leading spaces or tabs at the beginning of each line.
   - The `(?=\S)` is a lookahead that ensures the line contains at least one non-whitespace character following the spaces or tabs, thus, ignoring empty lines.

2. **Match Handling**:
   - The `string.match()` method is used with the regular expression to collect all matches in an array named `match`.

3. **Return Conditions**:
   - If `match` is `null` (meaning there are no non-empty lines), the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it uses `reduce()` to iterate over the array of matches and determines the minimum count of leading whitespace among all matched lines. Initially, the accumulator is set to `Infinity`, ensuring any real number of spaces will replace it.

The function essentially determines the "most common" base indentation level for content across a multiline string, ignoring completely empty lines.

Here's the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = function findMinIndentation(string) {
	// Find matches of leading spaces or tabs in each line with at least one non-space character
	const matches = string.match(/^[ \t]*(?=\S)/gm);

	// If there are no non-empty lines, return 0
	if (!matches) {
		return 0;
	}

	// Reduce the matches to find the minimum length of leading whitespace
	return matches.reduce((currentMin, match) => {
		return Math.min(currentMin, match.length);
	}, Infinity);
};
```

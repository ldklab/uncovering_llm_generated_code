The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to conditionally set the `module.exports` to the `inherits` function from the Node.js `util` module if it's available. If the `inherits` function is not available (which might occur in certain non-Node.js environments), it defaults to another implementation found in the `inherits_browser.js` file. The code uses a try-catch block to handle the case where `util.inherits` is undefined or not a function, which indicates a non-Node.js environment.

Here's a possible rewrite of the provided code:

```javascript
let inherits;

try {
  const util = require('util');

  if (typeof util.inherits === 'function') {
    inherits = util.inherits;
  }
} catch (e) {
  // No operation is needed here since we will handle it outside the try-catch
}

if (!inherits) {
  inherits = require('./inherits_browser.js');
}

module.exports = inherits;
```

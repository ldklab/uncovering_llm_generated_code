The provided Node.js code attempts to export a function for inheritance, using a strategy that first tries to use the `inherits` function provided by the built-in `util` module. It uses a try-catch block to handle the case where `util.inherits` is not available or not a function, which would cause the code to throw an error. In this case, it falls back to a custom implementation by requiring and exporting `'./inherits_browser.js'`.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const util = require('util');
let inherits;

if (typeof util.inherits === 'function') {
  inherits = util.inherits;
} else {
  inherits = require('./inherits_browser.js');
}

module.exports = inherits;
```

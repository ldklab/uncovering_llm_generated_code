The functionality of this Node.js code is to export a function that facilitates inheritance between constructor functions in a Node.js environment. 

1. It first tries to import the `util` module from Node.js, which includes many utility functions, one of which is `inherits`.
2. It checks if `util.inherits` is a function. If it is, it assigns this function to `module.exports`, allowing other modules to use `inherits` with `require`.
3. If `util.inherits` does not exist (which would be a very rare case but can occur), it throws an error, which is then caught by the `catch` block.
4. In the `catch` block, it imports and assigns a function from `inherits_browser.js` to `module.exports`. This implies that `inherits_browser.js` provides a fallback mechanism or implementation of `inherits` for environments where `util.inherits` is unavailable, which might be useful in some browser-based scenarios.

Rewritten code:

```javascript
try {
  const util = require('util');
  /* istanbul ignore next */
  if (typeof util.inherits === 'function') {
    module.exports = util.inherits;
  } else {
    throw new Error('util.inherits is not a function');
  }
} catch (error) {
  /* istanbul ignore next */
  module.exports = require('./inherits_browser.js');
}
```

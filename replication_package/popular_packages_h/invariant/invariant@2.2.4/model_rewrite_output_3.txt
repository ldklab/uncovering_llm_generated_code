The Node.js code defines a function called `invariant` that serves as a runtime assertion tool. It is used to assert a condition that is assumed to be true throughout the execution of a program. If the condition is false, an error is thrown with a message built using a `sprintf`-style format, supporting only the `%s` placeholder for string substitution. 

In non-production environments, if no format is provided, an error is thrown. In production, the message is minimized to prevent giving full details about the assertion failure, only indicating an exception has occurred.

If the condition fails, the error message utilizes placeholders to dynamically insert additional information to detail what was expected. The function guarantees an error is thrown if assumptions break, without affecting production logic, as the assertion remains present.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const invariant = (condition, format, ...args) => {
  const NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV;

  if (NODE_ENV !== 'production' && format === undefined) {
    throw new Error('invariant requires an error message argument');
  }

  if (!condition) {
    let error;
    if (format === undefined) {
      error = new Error(
        'Minified exception occurred; use the non-minified dev environment ' +
        'for the full error message and additional helpful warnings.'
      );
    } else {
      let argIndex = 0;
      error = new Error(
        format.replace(/%s/g, () => args[argIndex++])
      );
      error.name = 'Invariant Violation';
    }

    error.framesToPop = 1;
    throw error;
  }
};

module.exports = invariant;
```

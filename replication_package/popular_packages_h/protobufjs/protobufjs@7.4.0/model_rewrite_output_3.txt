The provided Node.js code is a simple module entry point for a library. It uses the CommonJS module system to export the contents from another module, located at `./src/index`, as the public API of the library. This allows users to access the functionality defined in `./src/index` when they require this module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Main entry point for the library.

"use strict";

const library = require("./src/index");

module.exports = library;
```

The Node.js code provided is the entry point for a library. It uses strict mode to enforce better coding practices by generating errors for common mistakes. The code exports the module located at `./src/index`, making it available for use when this library is imported by other files or projects.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
// Main entry point for the library

"use strict";

const libraryMain = require("./src/index");

module.exports = libraryMain;
```

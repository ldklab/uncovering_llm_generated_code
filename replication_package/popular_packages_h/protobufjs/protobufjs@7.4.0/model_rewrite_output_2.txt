The Node.js code serves as an entry point for a library. It utilizes the `require` function to import and export the contents of a module located in `./src/index`. This means when the library is included in another project, it will load whatever is exported from this `index.js` file. The code uses `"use strict";` at the beginning to enable JavaScript's strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables unintentionally.

Here is the rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Entry point for the entire library

"use strict";

const libraryExports = require("./src/index");

module.exports = libraryExports;
```

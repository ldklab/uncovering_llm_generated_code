The given Node.js code is a module that sets up an entry point for a larger library or application. It enforces strict mode using "use strict" for better error handling and security practices, then it exports the contents of another file located at "./src/index". This means that when this module is imported elsewhere in a project, it will provide the functionality defined in the "./src/index" module.

A possible rewrite of this code could be:

```javascript
"use strict";

const libraryEntryPoint = require("./src/index");

module.exports = libraryEntryPoint;
```

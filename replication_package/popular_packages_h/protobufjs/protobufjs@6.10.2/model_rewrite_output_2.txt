The given Node.js code is essentially the main entry point of a library. The purpose of this code is to export the contents of another module, located in the `./src/index` file, as the primary module that is exported when this library is required by other code. It uses `module.exports` to facilitate this export. The use of `"use strict";` indicates that the code should be executed in strict mode, which helps in catching common coding errors and improves overall performance.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
// Main entry point of the library

"use strict";

// Export the module from the specified path as the main module of this library
module.exports = require("./src/index");
```

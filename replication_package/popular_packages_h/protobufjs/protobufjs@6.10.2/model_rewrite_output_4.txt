The given Node.js code is a simple module entry point. It exports functionality from another file, located at `./src/index`, making that functionality available when this module is imported elsewhere in the codebase. 

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// Entry point for the full library

"use strict";

// Export the main functionality from the src/index file
module.exports = require("./src/index");
```

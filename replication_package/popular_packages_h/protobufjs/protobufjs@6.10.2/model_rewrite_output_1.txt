The code provided is a simple Node.js module entry point. It uses the CommonJS module system to export the functionality contained in another file. Specifically, it is exporting whatever is being exported from the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory. This allows other files or applications to import this module and use its functionality.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import and export the module from the relative path './src/index'
module.exports = require("./src/index");
```

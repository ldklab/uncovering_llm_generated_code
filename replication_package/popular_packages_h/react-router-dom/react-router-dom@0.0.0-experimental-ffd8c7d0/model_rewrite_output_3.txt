The provided Node.js code exports a module from either a production or a development version of a library, based on the current environment. It checks the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to determine whether it's set to `"production"`. If it is, it requires and exports the production version of the library located at `./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js`. If the environment is not set to `"production"`, it defaults to requiring and exporting the development version located at `./umd/react-router-dom.development.js`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const libraryPath = isProduction
  ? "./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js"
  : "./umd/react-router-dom.development.js";

module.exports = require(libraryPath);
```

The Node.js code is a module export statement that determines which file to require (import) based on the current environment setting. If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `"production"`, it requires the production version of the `react-router-dom` library, which is typically optimized and minified for performance. Otherwise, it requires the development version, which likely includes extra features such as debugging aids and warnings to assist developers during the development process.

Here's a possible rewrite for the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const reactRouterDom = isProduction
  ? require("./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js")
  : require("./umd/react-router-dom.development.js");

module.exports = reactRouterDom;
```

The given Node.js code is a module that exports a different file from the `umd` directory based on the current environment setting. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine if the environment is "production". If the environment is "production", it exports the minified production version of the React Router DOM library (`react-router-dom.production.min.js`). Otherwise, it exports the development version (`react-router-dom.development.js`) of the same library. This approach is commonly used to include optimized code for production environments and more verbose, developer-friendly code for development environments.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

let reactRouterDom;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  reactRouterDom = require("./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js");
} else {
  reactRouterDom = require("./umd/react-router-dom.development.js");
}

module.exports = reactRouterDom;
```

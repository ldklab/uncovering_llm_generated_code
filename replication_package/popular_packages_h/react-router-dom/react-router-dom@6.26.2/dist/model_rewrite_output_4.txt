The provided Node.js code is part of a module system that exports different builds of the "React Router DOM" library, depending on the current environment. If the environment is set to "production", it exports the minified production version of the library. Otherwise, it exports the development version. This behavior is achieved by checking the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, which is commonly used to determine whether the code is running in a development or production setting.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  module.exports = require("./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js");
} else {
  module.exports = require("./umd/react-router-dom.development.js");
}
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a specific version of the `react-router-dom` library based on the environment in which it's running. The code checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine the environment. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `"production"`, it exports the minified production version of the library. Otherwise, it exports the development version of the library. This approach ensures that the appropriate version of the library is loaded depending on whether the application is in development or production mode.

```javascript
'use strict';

/* eslint-env node */

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const prodFile = "./umd/react-router-dom.production.min.js";
const devFile = "./umd/react-router-dom.development.js";

module.exports = require(env === "production" ? prodFile : devFile);
```

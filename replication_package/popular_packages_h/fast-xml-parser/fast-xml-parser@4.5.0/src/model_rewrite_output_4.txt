The provided Node.js code is a module export pattern where various functionalities are organized and then made available for other modules to use by exporting them. The primary functionalities included are:

1. **XMLParser**: This is a parser that is imported from a local module located in a directory named `xmlparser`. The parser likely handles the parsing of XML data.

2. **XMLValidator**: This is a validator that validates XML data, and it is imported from a local module named `validator`.

3. **XMLBuilder**: This component likely deals with constructing or building XML data from JSON or other data structures. It is imported from a local module located in a directory named `xmlbuilder` under `json2xml`.

All these functionalities are then bundled together in a JavaScript object and exported using `module.exports`, allowing other parts of the application to use the XML parsing, validation, and building capabilities by importing this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const XMLValidator = require('./validator');
const XMLParser = require('./xmlparser/XMLParser');
const XMLBuilder = require('./xmlbuilder/json2xml');

module.exports = {
  XMLParser,
  XMLValidator,
  XMLBuilder
};
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports three main functionalities: 

1. **XMLParser**: This likely provides functionality to parse XML data into JavaScript objects. It's being imported from a local module located at './xmlparser/XMLParser'.

2. **XMLValidator**: This module is intended to validate XML data. It's being imported from another local module located at './validator'.

3. **XMLBuilder**: This module provides the ability to convert JSON data to XML format. It is being imported from './xmlbuilder/json2xml'.

Essentially, this code aggregates these three functionalities (parsing, validating, and building XML) into a single exported module, making them accessible for other parts of the application.

```javascript
'use strict';

const validator = require('./validator');
const XMLParser = require('./xmlparser/XMLParser');
const XMLBuilder = require('./xmlbuilder/json2xml');

module.exports = {
  XMLParser,
  XMLValidator: validator,
  XMLBuilder
};
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports three main components related to XML processing. It does the following:

1. It imports a custom `validator` function or object from a module located in the current directory (`./validator`). This could be used to validate XML content.
2. It imports `XMLParser` from a module located in a subdirectory (`./xmlparser/XMLParser`). This component is likely responsible for parsing XML strings into more manageable JavaScript objects or formats.
3. It imports `XMLBuilder` from another module located in a subdirectory (`./xmlbuilder/json2xml`). This component likely converts JSON or JavaScript objects back into XML strings.

The `module.exports` object is then configured to expose these three functionalities as `XMLParser`, `XMLValidator`, and `XMLBuilder`, making them available for use when this module is imported elsewhere in a Node.js application.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const validator = require('./validator');
const XMLParser = require('./xmlparser/XMLParser');
const XMLBuilder = require('./xmlbuilder/json2xml');

module.exports = {
  XMLParser,
  XMLValidator: validator,
  XMLBuilder,
};
```

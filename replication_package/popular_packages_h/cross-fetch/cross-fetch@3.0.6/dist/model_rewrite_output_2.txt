The Node.js code defines a wrapper around the `node-fetch` library, which is a module used for making HTTP requests. The main functionality of this code is to provide support for schemaless URIs (e.g., URLs that start with `//` instead of a specific protocol such as `http://` or `https://`) by automatically prepending `https:` to such URLs, ensuring uniform behavior between server-side and browser environments. 

Additionally, the code exports this customized fetch function alongside other components of the `node-fetch` library, such as `Headers`, `Request`, and `Response`, allowing users to work with HTTP request/response components conveniently. It also sets up compatibility for TypeScript consumers by using both commonjs exports and default exports, accommodating different module import styles.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');
const realFetch = nodeFetch.default || nodeFetch;

const fetch = (url, options) => {
  // Convert schemaless URIs to HTTPS URIs.
  if (url.startsWith('//')) {
    url = 'https:' + url;
  }
  
  return realFetch(url, options);
};

module.exports = fetch;
module.exports.fetch = fetch;
module.exports.Headers = nodeFetch.Headers;
module.exports.Request = nodeFetch.Request;
module.exports.Response = nodeFetch.Response;
module.exports.default = fetch;
```

The functionality of the Node.js code provided is as follows:

1. Imports the `node-fetch` library to use the `fetch` API in a Node.js environment.
2. Sets up a `fetch` function that can take a URL and options as parameters.
3. Handles schemaless URLs (URLs that start with `//`), which are automatically converted to use the `https:` protocol for consistency when running on the server, similar to how browsers handle them.
4. Utilizes the `node-fetch` `fetch` functionality to perform the HTTP requests.
5. Exposes the `fetch` function and relevant `node-fetch` objects (`Headers`, `Request`, `Response`) through the module's exports, allowing these resources to be used by other modules.
6. Ensures compatibility with TypeScript consumers by exporting `fetch` as the default export when `esModuleInterop` is not enabled.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');
const realFetch = nodeFetch.default || nodeFetch;

const fetch = (url, options) => {
  // Convert schemaless URIs to https on the server.
  if (/^\/\//.test(url)) {
    url = 'https:' + url;
  }
  return realFetch.call(this, url, options);
};

module.exports = fetch;
module.exports.fetch = fetch;
module.exports.Headers = nodeFetch.Headers;
module.exports.Request = nodeFetch.Request;
module.exports.Response = nodeFetch.Response;

// Export default for TypeScript consumers without esModuleInterop.
module.exports.default = fetch;
```

The functionality of the given Node.js code is as follows:

1. The code imports the `node-fetch` library, which is used for making HTTP requests.
2. It assigns `nodeFetch.default` to `realFetch` if available; otherwise, it assigns `nodeFetch`.
3. A custom `fetch` function is defined to handle URLs that start with `//`, often called schemaless URLs, by prefixing them with `https:` so that they can be properly fetched.
4. The custom `fetch` function is then exported along with the `Headers`, `Request`, and `Response` classes from the `node-fetch` library.
5. The module is compatible with both older and TypeScript consumers by handling different module export styles.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { default: defaultFetch, Headers, Request, Response } = require('node-fetch');

const realFetch = defaultFetch || require('node-fetch');

const fetch = (url, options) => {
  if (url.startsWith('//')) {
    url = 'https:' + url;
  }
  return realFetch(url, options);
};

module.exports = fetch;
fetch.fetch = fetch;
fetch.Headers = Headers;
fetch.Request = Request;
fetch.Response = Response;
fetch.default = fetch;
```

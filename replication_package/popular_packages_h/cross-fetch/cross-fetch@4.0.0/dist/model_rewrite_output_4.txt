The provided Node.js code is a wrapper around the `node-fetch` module. The functionality of the code can be summarized as follows:

1. **Importing node-fetch:** The code imports the `node-fetch` module to make HTTP requests in a server-side environment. It assigns the actual fetch function from the module to a variable `realFetch`.

2. **Custom Fetch Function:** A custom `fetch` function is defined, which adds a utility to handle URL schemes. If the URL starts with `//` (schemaless, as often used in browsers), it prepends `https:` to it, ensuring it becomes a fully qualified URL.

3. **Ponyfill Property:** The `fetch` function has a property `ponyfill` set to `true`, indicating that it’s a standalone function and doesn’t rely on global state. This is particularly useful when ensuring compatibility across different environments.

4. **Module Exports:** The custom `fetch` function, along with the `Headers`, `Request`, and `Response` classes from `node-fetch`, are exported. This allows users to utilize the fetch API with its associated classes. It also exports `fetch` as the default export, supporting TypeScript users who don’t have `esModuleInterop` enabled.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');

// Extract the default fetch from node-fetch, taking into account CommonJS import style.
const realFetch = nodeFetch.default || nodeFetch;

// Define a custom fetch function to handle schemaless URLs.
function fetch(url, options) {
  // Convert schemaless URLs to fully qualified URLs by prepending 'https:'.
  if (url.startsWith('//')) {
    url = 'https:' + url;
  }
  // Call the real fetch function with the possibly modified URL.
  return realFetch.call(this, url, options);
}

// Indicate that this is a ponyfill.
fetch.ponyfill = true;

// Export the custom fetch along with node-fetch components necessary for full fetch API support.
module.exports = exports = fetch;
exports.fetch = fetch;
exports.Headers = nodeFetch.Headers;
exports.Request = nodeFetch.Request;
exports.Response = nodeFetch.Response;

// Provide default export for compatibility with TypeScript users without esModuleInterop.
exports.default = fetch;
```

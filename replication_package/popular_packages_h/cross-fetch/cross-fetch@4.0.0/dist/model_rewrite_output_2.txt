The provided Node.js code is a wrapper around the `node-fetch` library. It modifies the fetch functionality to support schemaless URIs by prepending "https:" to URLs that start with `//`, which ensures they are treated as secure URLs. The code exports a fetch function and related fetch constructs such as `Headers`, `Request`, and `Response` from the `node-fetch` library. Also, it ensures compatibility with both CommonJS and ES module systems.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');
const { default: realFetch, Headers, Request, Response } = nodeFetch;

function customFetch(url, options) {
  // Append 'https:' to schemaless URIs for consistency across environments.
  if (url.startsWith('//')) {
    url = 'https:' + url;
  }
  return realFetch.call(this, url, options);
}

customFetch.ponyfill = true;

module.exports = customFetch;
module.exports.fetch = customFetch;
module.exports.Headers = Headers;
module.exports.Request = Request;
module.exports.Response = Response;
module.exports.default = customFetch;
```

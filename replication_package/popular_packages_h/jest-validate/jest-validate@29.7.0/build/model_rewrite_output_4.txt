The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export specific functionalities from different modules so that they can be used in other parts of an application. The script uses Object.defineProperty to export components, ensuring they are only included in the exports object if they're truly required by other parts of the application. It imports various utilities and validation functionalities from different modules and makes them available for external use. The `Object.defineProperty` method ensures that these exports are read-only and can provide getter functions for better encapsulation.

Here's a restructured version of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

import * as utils from './utils';
import validate from './validate';
import validateCLIOptions from './validateCLIOptions';
import { multipleValidOptions } from './condition';

export const ValidationError = utils.ValidationError;
export const createDidYouMeanMessage = utils.createDidYouMeanMessage;
export const format = utils.format;
export const logValidationWarning = utils.logValidationWarning;
export const multipleValidOptions = multipleValidOptions;
export const validate = validate;
export const validateCLIOptions = validateCLIOptions;
```

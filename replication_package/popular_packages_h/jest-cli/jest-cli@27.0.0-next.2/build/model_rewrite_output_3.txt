The given Node.js code is using ECMAScript module syntax to export a member from another module. Here is an explanation of how the code works:

1. The code begins by creating an object property on the `exports` object named `__esModule` and sets it to `true`. This is a common practice when using Babel or other transpilers to indicate that the code is an ES module.

2. The code uses `Object.defineProperty` to add a `run` property to the `exports` object. 
   - This property is marked as enumerable, meaning it will show up in `for...in` loops or `Object.keys()`, for example.
   - This property has a getter function that returns `_cli.run`, which implies `_cli` is another module or object imported from `./cli`.

3. The `var _cli = require('./cli');` statement requires the `cli` module located in the same directory. This module is assumed to have a `run` method or property that is being re-exported.

The overall functionality is to make the `run` function or property from the `./cli` module available to be imported from this module.

```javascript
'use strict';

import { run as cliRun } from './cli';

export { cliRun as run };
```

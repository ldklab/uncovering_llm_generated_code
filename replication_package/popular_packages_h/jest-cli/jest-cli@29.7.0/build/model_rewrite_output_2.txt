The Node.js code provided is a module that exports specific properties from two other modules, `run` and `args`. The module makes use of ES6 features and exposes certain properties, in this case, `run` and `yargsOptions`, from these modules for use in other files.

1. **Module Importing:** 
   - The `require` function is used to import functionalities from the `./run` and `./args` modules, assigning them to `_run` and `_args` respectively.

2. **Export Definition:**
   - The `exports` object is used to define the properties that will be available when this module is imported elsewhere.
   - `run`: The `run` property from the `_run` object, which comes from the `./run` module, is exposed as `run` in this module.
   - `yargsOptions`: The `options` property from the `_args` object, which comes from the `./args` module, is exposed as `yargsOptions` in this module.
  
3. **ES6 Features:**
   - `Object.defineProperty` is used to explicitly specify the enumeration and getter for each property being exported, enhancing control over the exported module's properties.
   - `__esModule` is set to true, marking this module's export as an ES6 module.

Rewritten Code:

```javascript
'use strict';

export { run } from './run';
export { options as yargsOptions } from './args';
```

This rewritten code utilizes ES6 `export` syntax to achieve the same functionality in a more modern and concise manner, directly exporting the desired functionalities from the imported modules.

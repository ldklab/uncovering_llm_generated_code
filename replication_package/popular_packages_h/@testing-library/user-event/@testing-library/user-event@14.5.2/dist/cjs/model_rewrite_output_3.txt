The Node.js code is a module that exports functionalities primarily from an `index` module and an `options` module. The code is written using CommonJS modules but makes use of ES Module syntax for defining exports. Here's the breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code starts with `'use strict';` to enable strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and prevents the use of some features that are considered problematic.

2. It imports the `index` module from `./setup/index.js` and the `options` module from `./options.js`.

3. The `index.userEvent` is exported as the default export and also as a named export under `exports.userEvent`. This means the same functionality can be imported using both default and named import syntax in other modules that import this module.

4. A specific property, `PointerEventsCheckLevel`, is exported from the `options` module. This is done via a property descriptor, allowing this property to be directly accessed from the `exports` object with a getter function. The `enumerable: true` attribute makes this exported property enumerable.

Based on this explanation, the rewritten code is as follows:

```javascript
'use strict';

Object.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', { value: true });

const index = require('./setup/index.js');
const options = require('./options.js');

exports.default = index.userEvent;
exports.userEvent = index.userEvent;
Object.defineProperty(exports, "PointerEventsCheckLevel", {
  enumerable: true,
  get: function() { return options.PointerEventsCheckLevel; }
});
```

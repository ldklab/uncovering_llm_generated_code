The provided Node.js code is quite simple but not very descriptive. Here's what it does:

1. The code is using strict mode by adding `"use strict";` at the beginning. This is a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in your JavaScript code, usually to catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions.

2. It requires a module or file named `"./extend-expect"`. This means that it is importing whatever is exported from the "extend-expect" module or file located relative to the current file. The exact functionality of the script would depend on what "extend-expect" does, which is not mentioned in the provided code snippet. However, given the name, it could be extending or adding additional functionality to an existing set of tools or libraries, possibly for testing purposes like extending Jest's `expect`.

With this explanation in mind, here's a rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
"use strict";

require("./extend-expect");
```
This rewrite is essentially the same as the original since the functionality is minimalistic and concise, capturing precisely what is present in the original code.

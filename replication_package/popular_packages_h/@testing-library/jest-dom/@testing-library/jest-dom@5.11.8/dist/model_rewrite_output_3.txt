The provided Node.js code snippet is seemingly straightforward and contains two main features:

1. **Strict Mode Activation**: The code uses the directive `"use strict";` at the top. This is a JavaScript feature that enables strict mode, which aims to catch common coding bloopers, prevents certain actions from being taken, and throws more exceptions. Strict mode helps in writing "safer" JavaScript by scoping global variables to their containing script and disallowing the use of undeclared variables, among other things.

2. **Module Requirement**: The code uses the `require` function to import a module named `"./extend-expect"`. This means it's likely a custom file or module that extends the capabilities of existing functionalities or libraries, possibly related to assertions or expectations in a testing framework like Jest.

With this explanation, here is a possible rewriting of the original code with comments that make its intentions clear:

```javascript
"use strict"; // Enable JavaScript strict mode for safer code

// Import the custom module that modifies or extends existing functionalities
const extendExpect = require("./extend-expect");

// Additional logic could be applied here, utilizing the features from `extend-expect`
// For instance, if this module extends Jest's expect features, this script might be
// part of a setup file for a testing suite
```

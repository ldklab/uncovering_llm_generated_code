The Node.js code provided performs a single task:

1. It uses the `require` function to import and execute a module named `./extend-expect`. 

The `require` function is part of Node.js's module system, used to include modules (other JavaScript files or libraries) within a Node.js application. By using `require("./extend-expect")`, this code loads and executes the module located in the local directory (as indicated by the `./`), which is named `extend-expect.js` or might be a directory containing an `index.js` file or a package.json declaring a main entry.

This code assumes that `extend-expect` is a module that extends or modifies existing functionalitiesâ€”potentially related to testing, given the naming pattern which is commonly seen in libraries like Jest for testing assertions.

Here's a possible rewritten version of the above code, assuming the described functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import and execute functionalities from the 'extend-expect' module.
// This may extend or add custom assertions to the testing environment.
require("./extend-expect");
```

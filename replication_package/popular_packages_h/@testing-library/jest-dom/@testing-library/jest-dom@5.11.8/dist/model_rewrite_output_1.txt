The given Node.js code is very brief and primarily does two things:

1. It enforces strict mode by using `"use strict";`. This is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions, such as using undeclared variables.

2. It requires the file `"./extend-expect"` using Node.js's `require` function. This suggests that this file is likely a module or script that extends or modifies the default functionality of `expect`, which is commonly used in testing frameworks to make assertions about your code. The specific contents or functions provided by `"./extend-expect"` are not detailed in the provided snippet and would depend on the actual contents of that file.

Here is a possible rewrite that achieves the same functionality:

```js
"use strict";

// Import and execute the file that extends or enhances the functionality of expect
const extendExpect = require("./extend-expect");
```

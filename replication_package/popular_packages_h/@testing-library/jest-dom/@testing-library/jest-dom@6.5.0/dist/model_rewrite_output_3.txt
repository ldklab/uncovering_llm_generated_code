The given Node.js code is setting up a testing environment by using the `expect` assertion library and extending it with custom matchers defined in a separate module. The code begins by importing several modules and dependencies that are likely used by the custom matchers for functionality related to CSS tools, string normalization, accessibility, and more. The `matchers` module is imported and its `extensions` are added to the `expect` library, enabling custom assertions in the tests.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the custom matchers module and other dependencies
var matchers = require('./matchers-4fe91ec3.js');
require('redent');
require('@adobe/css-tools');
require('dom-accessibility-api');
require('aria-query');
require('chalk');
require('lodash/isEqualWith.js');
require('css.escape');

// Extend the `expect` assertion library with custom matchers
expect.extend(matchers.extensions);
```

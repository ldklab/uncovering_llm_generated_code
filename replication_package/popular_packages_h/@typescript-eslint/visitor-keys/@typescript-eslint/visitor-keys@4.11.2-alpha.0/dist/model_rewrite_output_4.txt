The given Node.js code is a module that exports two functions, `getKeys` and `visitorKeys`, from separate modules called `get-keys` and `visitor-keys`, respectively. It uses `Object.defineProperty` to define these exports with specific properties such that they are enumerable and get their values from the imported modules. The code also instructs to include a source map comment at the end of the file.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

const { getKeys } = require("./get-keys");
const { visitorKeys } = require("./visitor-keys");

exports.getKeys = getKeys;
exports.visitorKeys = visitorKeys;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

The functionality of the Node.js code provided is to export two functions, `getKeys` and `visitorKeys`, from their respective modules, `get-keys` and `visitor-keys`. It is using ES6 features to define property exports and ensuring these properties are enumerable for module consumers. The code is also strict mode compliant, improving error handling by catching common JavaScript mistakes.

Below is the possible rewrite for this code based on the explanation:

```javascript
"use strict";

exports.__esModule = true;

const getKeysModule = require("./get-keys");
exports.getKeys = getKeysModule.getKeys;

const visitorKeysModule = require("./visitor-keys");
exports.visitorKeys = visitorKeysModule.visitorKeys;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that exports two specific functions, `getKeys` and `visitorKeys`, from two separate modules named `get-keys` and `visitor-keys`. The code uses the CommonJS module system and employs ES6 features such as `Object.defineProperty` to control how these exports can be accessed.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import { getKeys as importedGetKeys } from "./get-keys";
import { visitorKeys as importedVisitorKeys } from "./visitor-keys";

export const getKeys = importedGetKeys;
export const visitorKeys = importedVisitorKeys;

//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map
```

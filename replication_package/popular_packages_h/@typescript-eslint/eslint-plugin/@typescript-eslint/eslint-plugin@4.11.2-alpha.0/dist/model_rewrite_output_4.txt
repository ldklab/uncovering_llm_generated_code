The given Node.js code imports various configurations and rules from different files and then exports them as a module. This module contains a single `rules` property and a `configs` object with several configurations. Each imported module is given a default import, potentially designed to work with TypeScript's module interoperability. The code structure ensures that the consumer of this module has access to predefined ESLint rules and configurations that are organized into categories like "all", "base", "recommended", "eslint-recommended", and "recommended-requiring-type-checking".

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const rules = require("./rules");
const all = require("./configs/all");
const base = require("./configs/base");
const recommended = require("./configs/recommended");
const recommendedRequiringTypeChecking = require("./configs/recommended-requiring-type-checking");
const eslintRecommended = require("./configs/eslint-recommended");

module.exports = {
    rules: rules,
    configs: {
        all: all,
        base: base,
        recommended: recommended,
        'eslint-recommended': eslintRecommended,
        'recommended-requiring-type-checking': recommendedRequiringTypeChecking,
    },
};
```

The Node.js code is checking the environment in which the application is running. It looks at the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine this. If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, then the code exports the module located at `'./index.cjs.production.min.js'`, which is presumably a minified version optimized for production environments. Otherwise, it exports `'./index.cjs.development.js'`, which is likely a version with more debugging information suitable for development environments.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const modulePath = env === 'production' 
  ? './index.cjs.production.min.js' 
  : './index.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

The provided Node.js code is setting up module exports based on the current environment. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is in a 'production' or 'development' state. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports a minified version of a CommonJS module (`index.cjs.production.min.js`), which is usually optimized for performance and smaller file size to be used in production environments. Otherwise, it exports a development version of the module (`index.cjs.development.js`), which might include additional features such as debugging tools or more detailed error messages to assist with development.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code:

```js
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction ? './index.cjs.production.min.js' : './index.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

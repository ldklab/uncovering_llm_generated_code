The given Node.js script is designed to export different modules based on the environment in which the application is running. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the current environment is 'production' or not. If `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production', it exports a minified production version of the module (`index.cjs.production.min.js`). If the environment is anything other than 'production', a development version of the module (`index.cjs.development.js`) is exported instead. This is a common practice to optimize performance and reduce file size in a production environment while maintaining more detailed debugging information during development.

```javascript
'use strict'

const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const productionModule = './index.cjs.production.min.js';
const developmentModule = './index.cjs.development.js';

module.exports = environment === 'production' ? require(productionModule) : require(developmentModule);
```

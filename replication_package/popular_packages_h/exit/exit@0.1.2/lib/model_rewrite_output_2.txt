The Node.js code provided is a module that exports a function `exit` for safely exiting a Node.js application while ensuring that all output streams (`stdout` and `stderr` by default) are fully drained before the process exits. This is important to prevent data loss, especially when the application is writing to these streams just before exiting.

Here’s how the code works:
1. The `exit` function takes two arguments: `exitCode` (the code with which the process should exit) and `streams` (an array of streams that should be drained before exiting, defaulting to `stdout` and `stderr`).
2. It initializes a counter `drainCount` to track how many streams have been drained.
3. It defines a helper function `tryToExit` that will call `process.exit(exitCode)` once all specified streams have been drained.
4. It iterates over each stream to check if the stream's buffer is already empty (drained). If a stream is drained, it increments `drainCount`.
5. If a stream is not yet drained, it writes an empty string to it. The callback of this `write` method increments `drainCount` and calls `tryToExit`.
6. The stream’s `write` method is overridden to do nothing, effectively preventing any further data from being written to the stream.
7. Immediately attempts to exit if all streams are already drained by calling `tryToExit`.
8. Adds a listener for the 'exit' event to ensure that the process exits with the specified exit code.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = function exit(exitCode, streams = [process.stdout, process.stderr]) {
  let drainCount = 0;

  const tryToExit = () => {
    if (drainCount === streams.length) {
      process.exit(exitCode);
    }
  };

  streams.forEach((stream) => {
    if (stream.bufferSize === 0) {
      drainCount++;
    } else {
      stream.write('', 'utf-8', () => {
        drainCount++;
        tryToExit();
      });
    }
    stream.write = () => {};
  });

  tryToExit();

  process.on('exit', () => {
    process.exit(exitCode);
  });
};
```

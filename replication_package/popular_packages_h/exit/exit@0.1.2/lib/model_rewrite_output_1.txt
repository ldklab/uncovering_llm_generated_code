The Node.js code provided is a module that exports a function `exit`. This function is designed to terminate a Node.js process with a specified exit code after ensuring that all specified streams (typically `stdout` and `stderr`) are completely drained. The function works as follows:

1. It takes two arguments: `exitCode` (the code with which to terminate the process) and an optional `streams` array (streams that need to be drained before exiting, defaulting to `process.stdout` and `process.stderr`).

2. It defines a `drainCount` variable initialized to zero, which tracks how many streams have been fully drained.

3. A helper function `tryToExit()` checks whether all streams are drained by comparing `drainCount` to the number of streams. If they are, it calls `process.exit(exitCode)` to terminate the process with the given exit code.

4. The function iterates over each stream in the `streams` array. For each stream:
   - If the stream's `bufferSize` is zero, it increments `drainCount`.
   - If the stream still has data to flush (i.e., `bufferSize` is not zero), it writes an empty string and provides a callback that increments `drainCount` and invokes `tryToExit()`.
   - It also modifies the streamâ€™s `write` function to become a no-op to prevent any further writes.
   
5. It invokes `tryToExit()`, which will exit immediately if all streams were already drained.

6. It sets up an `exit` event listener on the `process`, which ensures that the process exits with the intended `exitCode`. This is particularly useful for fixing a Node.js issue on Windows where the process may otherwise exit with a code of 0.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

module.exports = function exit(exitCode, streams = [process.stdout, process.stderr]) {
  let drainCount = 0;

  function tryToExit() {
    if (drainCount === streams.length) {
      process.exit(exitCode);
    }
  }

  streams.forEach((stream) => {
    if (stream.write === writeNoOp) return;
    if (stream.bufferSize === 0) {
      drainCount++;
    } else {
      stream.write('', 'utf-8', () => {
        drainCount++;
        tryToExit();
      });
    }
    
    stream.write = writeNoOp;
  });

  tryToExit();

  process.on('exit', () => {
    process.exit(exitCode);
  });
};

function writeNoOp() {}

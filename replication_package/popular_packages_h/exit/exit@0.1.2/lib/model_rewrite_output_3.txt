The Node.js code defines a module that exports a function called `exit`. This function is designed to exit a Node.js process with a specified exit code, but only after ensuring that all output streams (such as `stdout` and `stderr`) have finished draining. This functionality is useful when you want to make sure that all your logs or outputs are completely written to the terminal or a file before the script exits.

Key features of the code:
- The function accepts two parameters: `exitCode` (the code with which the process should exit) and `streams` (an array of output streams to monitor).
- If `streams` is not provided, it defaults to `[process.stdout, process.stderr]`.
- The code tracks how many of these streams are drained (`drainCount`) and exits the process when they are all drained.
- It handles the case where streams may still have buffered data by writing an empty string to them and using the streamâ€™s callback to update the `drainCount`.
- It overrides the `write` function of each stream to essentially disable further writes, ensuring no new data is sent to the streams after attempting to exit.
- The process is forcibly exited using an `exit` event listener to handle peculiarities on Windows platforms where the exit code may sometimes default to `0`.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = function exit(exitCode, streams = [process.stdout, process.stderr]) {
  let drainedStreams = 0;

  function checkAndExit() {
    if (drainedStreams === streams.length) {
      process.exit(exitCode);
    }
  }

  streams.forEach(stream => {
    if (stream.bufferSize === 0) {
      drainedStreams++;
    } else {
      stream.write('', 'utf-8', () => {
        drainedStreams++;
        checkAndExit();
      });
    }

    stream.write = () => {};
  });

  checkAndExit();

  process.on('exit', () => {
    process.exit(exitCode);
  });
};
```

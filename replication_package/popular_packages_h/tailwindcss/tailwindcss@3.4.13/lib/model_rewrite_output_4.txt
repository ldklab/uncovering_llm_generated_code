The Node.js code is exporting a module that is imported from a file named `plugin`. This syntax `require("./plugin")` is used to import the module located in the file named `plugin.js` (or `plugin/index.js` if `plugin.js` does not exist) in the same directory as the current file. The imported module is then made available for other files to use when they require the current file.

Below is a rewritten version of the original code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Export the contents of the plugin.js module.
const plugin = require("./plugin");
module.exports = plugin;
```

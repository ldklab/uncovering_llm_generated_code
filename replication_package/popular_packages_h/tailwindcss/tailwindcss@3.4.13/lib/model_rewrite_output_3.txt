The Node.js code is a very simple module export. It is designed to export whatever is being exported by another module located in the file called `plugin`. This means that when another file imports this module, it will receive the exports of the `plugin` module. Essentially, this code acts as a relay, passing through the exports from `plugin` to any module that imports this one.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const pluginExports = require("./plugin");

module.exports = pluginExports;
```

The given Node.js code is exporting a module, which is required from a file named `plugin.js` located in the same directory as this code. By using `module.exports`, it makes the exports of `plugin.js` available to any other file that imports this module.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const plugin = require("./plugin");
module.exports = plugin;
```

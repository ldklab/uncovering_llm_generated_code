The Node.js code is a simple module that exports whatever is being exported from the `"./plugin"` module. This means it acts as a re-exporter for the `"./plugin"` module, allowing other parts of the application to import the contents of `"./plugin"` through this module.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const pluginModule = require("./plugin");
module.exports = pluginModule;
```

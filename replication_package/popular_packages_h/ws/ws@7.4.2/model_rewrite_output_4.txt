The provided Node.js code is setting up a WebSocket interface within a JavaScript environment. It begins by importing a main WebSocket module from a specified local path, './lib/websocket'. Additional WebSocket-related components like `createWebSocketStream`, `Server`, `Receiver`, and `Sender` are also imported from their respective paths within the './lib' directory, and subsequently added as properties to the WebSocket object. Finally, the enhanced WebSocket object is exported as a module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const WebSocket = require('./lib/websocket');

WebSocket.createWebSocketStream = require('./lib/stream');
WebSocket.Server = require('./lib/websocket-server');
WebSocket.Receiver = require('./lib/receiver');
WebSocket.Sender = require('./lib/sender');

module.exports = WebSocket;
```

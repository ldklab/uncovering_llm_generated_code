The provided Node.js code is a module for working with WebSockets. It initially imports the main `WebSocket` class from a file located at `./lib/websocket`. Then, it extends this `WebSocket` object by assigning it additional properties:  
- `createWebSocketStream` is assigned a module from `./lib/stream`, which likely provides functionalities to create a WebSocket stream.
- `Server` is assigned a module from `./lib/websocket-server`, which probably provides functionalities for a WebSocket server.
- `Receiver` is assigned a module from `./lib/receiver`, likely managing the incoming data or messages over a WebSocket connection.
- `Sender` is assigned a module from `./lib/sender`, likely managing the outgoing data or messages over a WebSocket connection.

Finally, it exports the `WebSocket` object, which now includes all these additional functionalities.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const WebSocket = require('./lib/websocket');
const createWebSocketStream = require('./lib/stream');
const WebSocketServer = require('./lib/websocket-server');
const Receiver = require('./lib/receiver');
const Sender = require('./lib/sender');

WebSocket.createWebSocketStream = createWebSocketStream;
WebSocket.Server = WebSocketServer;
WebSocket.Receiver = Receiver;
WebSocket.Sender = Sender;

module.exports = WebSocket;
```

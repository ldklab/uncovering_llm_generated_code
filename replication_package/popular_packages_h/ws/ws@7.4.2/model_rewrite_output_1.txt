The Node.js code is configuring a WebSocket module by requiring a main `websocket` library and adding several properties to the `WebSocket` object. These properties include `createWebSocketStream`, `Server`, `Receiver`, and `Sender`, which are likely responsible for additional functionality and subcomponents of the WebSocket, such as handling streams, managing server-side connections, and sending or receiving data. Finally, the configured `WebSocket` object is exported for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
'use strict';

const WebSocket = require('./lib/websocket');

Object.assign(WebSocket, {
  createWebSocketStream: require('./lib/stream'),
  Server: require('./lib/websocket-server'),
  Receiver: require('./lib/receiver'),
  Sender: require('./lib/sender')
});

module.exports = WebSocket;
```

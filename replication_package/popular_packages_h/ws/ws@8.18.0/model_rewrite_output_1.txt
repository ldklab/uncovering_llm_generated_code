The provided Node.js code is part of a library for WebSocket communication. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Strict Mode:** The script is run in strict mode, which is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby catching common coding errors and "unsafe" actions.
   
2. **WebSocket Import:** The code imports a WebSocket module defined in the file located at `./lib/websocket`.

3. **Adding Components:** The script adds several components to the WebSocket object:
   - A method to create a WebSocket stream from `./lib/stream`.
   - A WebSocket server implementation from `./lib/websocket-server`.
   - A Receiver module from `./lib/receiver` used to process incoming data.
   - A Sender module from `./lib/sender` used to send data.

4. **Assignment for Compatibility:** The WebSocket object is structured to include properties such as `WebSocket` and `WebSocketServer`, which are helpful for clients of the module to consistently refer to these elements using common names.

5. **Module Exports:** The script exports the `WebSocket` object with all its attached properties and methods, making it accessible for other modules that require this WebSocket library.

Here is a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const WebSocket = require('./lib/websocket');

// Attach components to the WebSocket object
WebSocket.createWebSocketStream = require('./lib/stream');
WebSocket.Server = require('./lib/websocket-server');
WebSocket.Receiver = require('./lib/receiver');
WebSocket.Sender = require('./lib/sender');

// Provide synonyms for easier access
WebSocket.WebSocket = WebSocket;
WebSocket.WebSocketServer = WebSocket.Server;

// Export the WebSocket object
module.exports = WebSocket;
```

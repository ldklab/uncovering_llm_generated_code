The given Node.js code exports a function that generates a unique hash-like string. This function can produce two types of hashes based on whether an input (`uniq`) is provided or not.

Explanation of the code:
1. The code uses the `imurmurhash` module, which implements the MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm.
2. If a `uniq` string is provided as an argument:
   - A MurmurHash3 hash object is created with `uniq` as a seed.
   - The resulting hash is converted to a hexadecimal string.
   - The function returns the last 8 characters of the resulting hash, ensuring it's at least 8 characters by prepending zeroes as necessary.
3. If no `uniq` string is provided:
   - The function generates a random number between 0 and 1, converts it to a hexadecimal string, and slices out 8 characters from it.
   - This provides a pseudo-random hash-like string.

The rewritten code, maintaining the same functionality:

```js
'use strict';
const MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');

module.exports = function (uniq) {
  if (uniq) {
    const hash = new MurmurHash3(uniq);
    return hash.result().toString(16).padStart(8, '0').slice(-8);
  } else {
    return Math.random().toString(16).slice(2, 10).padEnd(8, '0');
  }
}
```

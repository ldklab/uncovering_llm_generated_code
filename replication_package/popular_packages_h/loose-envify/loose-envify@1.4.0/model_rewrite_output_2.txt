The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export a module that is the result of invoking the function `require('./loose-envify')` with an argument `process.env`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. It uses `'use strict';` mode to ensure the code is executed in strict mode, which helps in catching common coding bloopers, preventing the use of certain syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript, and making debugging easier.
   
2. The `require` function is used to import a module located at `'./loose-envify'`. This module export is expected to be a function.

3. The imported function from `./loose-envify` is immediately invoked with `process.env` as an argument. `process.env` is an object that contains the current environment variables.

4. The result of the function call `require('./loose-envify')(process.env)` is then exported from the module, making it available to other files that import this module.

The code essentially transforms the environment variables using the logic defined in `loose-envify` and exports the transformed result.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const looseEnvify = require('./loose-envify');
const envTransformed = looseEnvify(process.env);

module.exports = envTransformed;
```

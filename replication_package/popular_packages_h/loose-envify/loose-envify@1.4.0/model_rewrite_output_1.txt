The provided Node.js code snippet is making use of `loose-envify`, a package that is used to replace `process.env` variables in your code with their literal values. The functionality of this code is to export the result of invoking `loose-envify` with `process.env` as an argument. This allows for the environment variables to be replaced at build-time, typically during the bundling or transpilation process, optimizing the code for production. 

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const looseEnvify = require('./loose-envify');

module.exports = looseEnvify(process.env);
```

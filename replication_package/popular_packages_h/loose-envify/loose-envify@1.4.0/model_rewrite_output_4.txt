The given Node.js code is a simple module that exports the result of invoking a function from another module, `loose-envify`. The module `loose-envify` is required and executed with `process.env` as an argument. Here's what each part does:

1. `'use strict';`: This is a directive that enables strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables.

2. `module.exports = ...;`: This line exports whatever is returned by the invoked function from the `loose-envify` module. This allows other modules to import and use the returned value.

3. `require('./loose-envify')`: This part imports the `loose-envify` module located in the same directory as the current module.

4. `(process.env)`: This is an immediately invoked function expression where the imported `loose-envify` is called with `process.env`. `process.env` is a Node.js environment object that contains environment variables. The `loose-envify` function most likely processes these variables in some way to return a modified result.

A possible rewrite of this code might look like this:

```javascript
'use strict';

const looseEnvify = require('./loose-envify');

// Execute looseEnvify with process.env and export the result
module.exports = looseEnvify(process.env);
```

The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export the result of invoking a function from a module named `loose-envify` with the current environment variables (`process.env`) as its argument. This is accomplished in two main steps:

1. The `require('./loose-envify')` statement imports a module named `loose-envify` located in the same directory as the current script. The imported module is expected to export a function.
2. This function is immediately called with `process.env`, which is a built-in Node.js object containing the user's environment variables, as its parameter.
3. The result of this function call is then exported as the module's own export.

Here's a rewritten version of the code, providing the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const looseEnvify = require('./loose-envify');
const environmentVariables = process.env;
const transformedEnv = looseEnvify(environmentVariables);

module.exports = transformedEnv;
```

The provided Node.js code is responsible for exporting a `WebpackCLI` component, which presumably is a class or function imported from the file './webpack-cli'. Besides the core export of this `WebpackCLI`, the code also exports a set of utility functions (or objects) under the `module.exports.utils` property. These utilities include a logger, a set of CLI commands, and a function to get the current package manager, all imported from their respective modules.

Here's a potential rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const WebpackCLI = require('./webpack-cli');
const { commands } = require('./utils/cli-flags');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');
const getPackageManager = require('./utils/get-package-manager');

const utils = {
    logger,
    commands,
    getPackageManager,
};

module.exports = WebpackCLI;
module.exports.utils = utils;
```

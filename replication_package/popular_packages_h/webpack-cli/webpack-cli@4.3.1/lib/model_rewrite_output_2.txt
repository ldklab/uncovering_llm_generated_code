The given Node.js code is for a module that exports a WebpackCLI class or function from a local file './webpack-cli'. Additionally, it extends this export with a 'utils' object that includes several utilities used by other packages. These utilities are imported from './utils/cli-flags', './utils/logger', and './utils/get-package-manager', and they offer logging functionality, command extraction, and package manager retrieval, respectively.

```javascript
const WebpackCLI = require('./webpack-cli');
const { commands } = require('./utils/cli-flags');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');
const getPackageManager = require('./utils/get-package-manager');

module.exports = WebpackCLI;

// Extend export with additional utilities
module.exports.utils = {
    logger,
    commands,
    getPackageManager,
};
```

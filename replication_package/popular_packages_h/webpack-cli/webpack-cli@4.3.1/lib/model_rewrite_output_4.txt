This Node.js code is exporting a module related to Webpack CLI functionality. It first imports the `WebpackCLI` class or function from the `./webpack-cli` file. It also imports three utility components: `commands` from `./utils/cli-flags`, `logger` from `./utils/logger`, and `getPackageManager` from `./utils/get-package-manager`. The main export of this module is `WebpackCLI`, but it also exports a `utils` object containing the imported utilities for use by other packages.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const WebpackCLI = require('./webpack-cli');
const cliFlags = require('./utils/cli-flags');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');
const getPackageManager = require('./utils/get-package-manager');

module.exports = WebpackCLI;

module.exports.utils = {
    logger,
    commands: cliFlags.commands,
    getPackageManager,
};
```

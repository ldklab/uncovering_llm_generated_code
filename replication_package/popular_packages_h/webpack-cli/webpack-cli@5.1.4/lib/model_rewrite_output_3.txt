The provided code is a Node.js module that imports a specific module or class from a file named `webpack-cli` and then exports it. The purpose of this code is to make the CLI functionality available to other modules that import this one. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `"use strict";` - This line is used to ensure that the code is executed in strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and prevents certain unsafe actions.

2. `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });` - This line sets a property on the `exports` object to indicate that this module is using ES module semantics, possibly to provide compatibility or recognition with tooling expecting such a flag.

3. `const CLI = require("./webpack-cli");` - This line imports the content of the `webpack-cli` module into a constant named `CLI`.

4. `module.exports = CLI;` - This line sets `CLI` as the exported value of the module, making it available to other modules that require (or import) this module.

A possible rewrite, preserving the same functionality, could look like this:

```node
"use strict";

// Import the CLI functionality from webpack-cli
const CLI = require("./webpack-cli");

// Export the CLI for use in other modules
module.exports = CLI;
```

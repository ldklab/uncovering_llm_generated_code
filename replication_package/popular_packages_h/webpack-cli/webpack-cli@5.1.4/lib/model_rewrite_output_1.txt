The provided Node.js code is a module that exports functionality from another module named `webpack-cli`. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. The code is in "strict mode" to enforce a more secure and error-free JavaScript.
2. It defines that this module exports a feature. `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });` is used to set the `__esModule` property to `true`, indicating that this module is compatible with ES6 modules.
3. The `require` function is used to import the `webpack-cli` module, and it's assigned to the `CLI` constant. This suggests that `webpack-cli` is a CommonJS module.
4. Finally, the module exports the imported `CLI` so that when another file imports this module, it receives whatever is exported by `webpack-cli`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the webpack-cli module using require
const CLI = require("./webpack-cli");

// Set the __esModule property to true to indicate ES6 module compatibility
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

// Export the CLI module so that other files importing this file receive CLI
module.exports = CLI;
```

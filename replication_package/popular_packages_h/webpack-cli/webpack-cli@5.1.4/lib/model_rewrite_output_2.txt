The Node.js code provided is a module that exports functionality from another module, specifically the `webpack-cli`. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `"use strict";`: This directive is used to enable strict mode, which helps catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions such as defining global variables accidentally.

2. `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });`: This line is used when working with ECMAScript modules and CommonJS modules interop. It ensures that `exports` is treated as an ES module.

3. `const CLI = require("./webpack-cli");`: This line imports the `webpack-cli` module using CommonJS `require` syntax, storing the exported functionality in the constant `CLI`.

4. `module.exports = CLI;`: This line exports the `CLI` variable from this module, meaning any module that `require`s this one will receive whatever is exported by `webpack-cli`.

Here is a possible rewritten version of this code that maintains the original functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the `webpack-cli` module using CommonJS require
const CLI = require("./webpack-cli");

// Mark this module as an ECMAScript module
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

// Export the imported `CLI` object as the module's public API
module.exports = CLI;
```

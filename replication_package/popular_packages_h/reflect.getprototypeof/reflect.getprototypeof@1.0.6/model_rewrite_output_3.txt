The Node.js code is designed to provide a bound version of a polyfill function along with associated metadata and functionality for shimming. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports and Dependencies:** It starts by importing required dependencies: `call-bind` to bind functions, `define-properties` to add properties to objects, along with custom modules for `implementation`, `getPolyfill`, and `shim`.

2. **Polyfill Binding:** The function returned by `getPolyfill` is bound using `callBind`. If `Reflect` is available, it will be used as the context for binding; otherwise, `Object` will be used.

3. **Property Definition:** The `bound` object, which represents the bound polyfill function, is augmented with additional properties: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`. The `define` function from `define-properties` is used to attach these properties to `bound`.

4. **Module Export:** Finally, the `bound` function (with its attached properties) is exported as a module, making it accessible for use in other parts of an application.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const reflectOrObject = typeof Reflect === 'object' ? Reflect : Object;
const polyfillFunction = getPolyfill();
const boundPolyfill = callBind(polyfillFunction, reflectOrObject);

defineProperties(boundPolyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundPolyfill;
```

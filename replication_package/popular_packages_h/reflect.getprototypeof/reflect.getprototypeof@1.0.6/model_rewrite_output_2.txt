The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function which is a bound version of a polyfill function. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **Strict Mode**: The `'use strict';` directive at the top enables strict mode which helps catch common coding errors and "unsafe" actions.

2. **Module Imports**:
   - `callBind`: A utility to bind a function to a context (i.e., to ensure that the function has a specific `this` value).
   - `define`: A utility to define properties on an object.
   - `implementation`, `getPolyfill`, `shim`: These are custom modules presumably contained within the same package or project. 
     - `implementation`: Likely contains the actual implementation of a feature.
     - `getPolyfill`: Likely determines whether a polyfill is needed and returns it.
     - `shim`: Likely provides a way to augment or fill in missing functionality.

3. **Main Functionality**:
   - `bound`: A function that takes the polyfill (result of `getPolyfill()`) and binds it to `Reflect` if available, otherwise to `Object`. This binding ensures that the polyfill function will have a specific context when called.

4. **Property Definition**: The `define` function is used to add additional properties to `bound`. These properties are references to the `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` functions/modules.

5. **Exports**: The module exports the `bound` function, which now has extra properties attached to it. This allows any consuming code to call the `bound` function and also access the defined properties directly from the export.

Here's the rewritten code incorporating the explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const define = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Bind the polyfill to Reflect if it exists, otherwise to Object
const bound = callBind(
    getPolyfill(),
    typeof Reflect === 'object' ? Reflect : Object
);

// Define additional properties on the bound function
define(bound, {
    getPolyfill,
    implementation,
    shim
});

// Export the bound function with additional properties
module.exports = bound;
```

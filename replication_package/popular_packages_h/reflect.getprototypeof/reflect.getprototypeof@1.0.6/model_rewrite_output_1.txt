The given Node.js code is organizing a module that uses the `callBind` function to bind a polyfilled version of a function, likely to be a feature not natively supported in all environments. The `getPolyfill` function is retrieving the appropriate polyfill, and `implementation` possibly offers a fallback or default implementation. The `shim` function is likely providing a way to close the gap between environments that lack this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of what each part does:
- `callBind` is used to bind a function to the context of `Reflect` if available, else `Object`.
- `define` is used to add properties to the `bound` function which include `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`.
- The `bound` function is exported as the module.

Now, here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const baseObject = (typeof Reflect === 'object') ? Reflect : Object;
const boundFunction = callBind(getPolyfill(), baseObject);

defineProperties(boundFunction, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundFunction;
```

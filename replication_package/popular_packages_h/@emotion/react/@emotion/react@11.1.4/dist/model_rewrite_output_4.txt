The provided Node.js code is a conditional module export based on the environment in which the code is running. The code checks the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to "production", the module exports the production version of the `emotion-react` library, which is located at `"./emotion-react.cjs.prod.js"`. This likely represents the optimized and minimized version of the library for use in production environments.
  
- If `NODE_ENV` is anything other than "production" (typically set to "development" during application development), it exports the development version of the library at `"./emotion-react.cjs.dev.js"`, which may include more verbose logging, error messages, and debugging features to aid development.

Here's a rewritten version of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
const moduleToExport = env === "production" 
  ? "./emotion-react.cjs.prod.js" 
  : "./emotion-react.cjs.dev.js";

module.exports = require(moduleToExport);
```

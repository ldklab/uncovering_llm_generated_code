The provided Node.js code is an entry point that exports different versions of a module depending on the environment in which the application is running. The code checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is in "production" mode or another mode such as "development". If the `NODE_ENV` is set to "production", it exports a module optimized for production usage from `./emotion-react.cjs.prod.js`, otherwise, it exports the development version from `./emotion-react.cjs.dev.js`. This conditional module export is a common practice to improve performance and reduce file size in production environments while retaining useful debugging information in development.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const modulePath = isProduction ? "./emotion-react.cjs.prod.js" : "./emotion-react.cjs.dev.js";

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

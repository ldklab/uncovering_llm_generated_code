The given Node.js code is used to dynamically export a module based on the current environment. It checks the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to determine whether the application is running in a production or development environment. If `NODE_ENV` is set to "production", it exports the production version of the module located at `./emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js`. Otherwise, it defaults to exporting the development version of the module at `./emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js`. This approach helps in optimizing the application by using a lighter, possibly optimized module for production environments and a more verbose version with additional debug information for development.

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const modulePath = isProduction ? "./emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js" : "./emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js";
module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

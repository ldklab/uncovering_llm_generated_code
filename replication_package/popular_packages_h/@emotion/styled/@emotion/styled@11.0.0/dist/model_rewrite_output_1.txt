The Node.js code is a conditional module export that distinguishes between production and development environments. It checks the value of the environment variable `NODE_ENV`. If it is set to "production", the code exports the module from the file `emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js`, which is presumably optimized for production use. Otherwise, it exports the module from `emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js`, typically configured for easier debugging and development purposes. This approach helps in loading the appropriate version of a module based on the environment.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const modulePath = isProduction ? "./emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js" : "./emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js";

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

The provided Node.js code checks the environment in which the application is running and conditionally exports a different module based on whether the environment is production or development. This approach is typically used to optimize code during deployment:

- If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `"production"`, it exports the production version of the `emotion-styled` library from the `emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js` file.
- If the `NODE_ENV` is not set to `"production"`, it defaults to exporting the development version of the `emotion-styled` library from the `emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js` file.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
const modulePath = isProduction ? "./emotion-styled.cjs.prod.js" : "./emotion-styled.cjs.dev.js";

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

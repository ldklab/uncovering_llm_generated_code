The provided Node.js code exports the `randomBytes` function from the built-in `crypto` library. This function is used for generating cryptographically strong pseudo-random data in the form of a Buffer, which can be useful for creating secure tokens or keys.

Here's a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
const { randomBytes } = require('crypto');
module.exports = randomBytes;
```

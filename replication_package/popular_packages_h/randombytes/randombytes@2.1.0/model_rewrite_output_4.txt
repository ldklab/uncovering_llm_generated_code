The provided Node.js code is a module export that directly exports the `randomBytes` function from the built-in 'crypto' module. This means that any other module requiring this one will have access to the `randomBytes` function to generate cryptographically strong pseudo-random data. The `randomBytes` function is often used to generate random data for cryptographic purposes, and by exporting it directly, it allows other parts of the application to utilize this functionality without importing the entire 'crypto' module themselves.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { randomBytes } = require('crypto');

module.exports = randomBytes;
```

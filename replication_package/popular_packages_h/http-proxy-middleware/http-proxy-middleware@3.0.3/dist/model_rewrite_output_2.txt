The Node.js code provided is used to export modules and make certain components accessible to other parts of the application. It does this by using `__exportStar` and `__createBinding` functions, which are common in TypeScript-compiled JavaScript to handle multiple module exports. The code essentially imports entities from different modules (`./factory`, `./handlers`, `./plugins/default`, and `./legacy`) and re-exports them for use in other parts of the application, excluding the `default` export. 

Hereâ€™s a possible rewrite of the code without explicitly using the auxiliary functions like `__createBinding` and `__exportStar` since the same objective can be achieved more simplistically by directly using JavaScript/TypeScript module exporting features:

```javascript
"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

export * from "./factory";
export * from "./handlers";
/**
 * Default plugins
 */
export * from "./plugins/default";
/**
 * Legacy exports
 */
export * from "./legacy";
```

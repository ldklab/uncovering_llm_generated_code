The provided Node.js code is an initialization script for a module named `Sharp`. The script begins by requiring the `Sharp` module from a local file called `constructor.js`. It then sequentially requires several other modules, which are intended to define and augment `Sharp`'s functionality. Each of these modules—`input.js`, `resize.js`, `composite.js`, `operation.js`, `colour.js`, `channel.js`, `output.js`, and `utility.js`—export a function that likely adds specific capabilities or methods to the `Sharp` object. After integrating all these functionalities into `Sharp`, the script exports it as a module.

Here's how the code could be rewritten, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const Sharp = require('./constructor');

// Augment Sharp with additional functionality
const modules = [
  './input',
  './resize',
  './composite',
  './operation',
  './colour',
  './channel',
  './output',
  './utility'
];

modules.forEach(module => {
  require(module)(Sharp);
});

module.exports = Sharp;
```

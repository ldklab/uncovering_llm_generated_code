The Node.js code provided is a module that exports a function called `createHttpProxyAgent`. This function takes options as an argument (`opts`) and returns a new instance of `agent_1.default`, which is imported from a file called `agent`. The `createHttpProxyAgent` function is also augmented to include the class `HttpProxyAgent` and its prototype from `agent_1.default`, making them accessible properties of the function itself. Lastly, this function is exported as a module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const agent = require("./agent");

function createHttpProxyAgent(opts) {
    return new agent(opts);
}

createHttpProxyAgent.HttpProxyAgent = agent;
createHttpProxyAgent.prototype = agent.prototype;

module.exports = createHttpProxyAgent;
```

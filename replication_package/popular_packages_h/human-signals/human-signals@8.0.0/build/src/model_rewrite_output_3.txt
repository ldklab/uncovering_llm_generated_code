The Node.js code is designed to parse and organize signal information, which is often used in the context of process control and management. The code does the following:

1. **Imports necessary modules and constants**: 
   - It imports `constants` from the Node.js `os` module to access system-level signal constants.
   - It imports `SIGRTMAX` from a local `realtime.js` module, which likely indicates the maximum number of real-time signals available.
   - It imports a `getSignals` function from a local `signals.js` module, which presumably provides an array of signal data.

2. **Functions to organize signals**:
   - `getSignalsByName`: This function retrieves signals using `getSignals`, and transforms the list into an object (dictionary) keyed by signal names. It uses `getSignalByName` to create key-value pairs for the dictionary.
   - `getSignalByNumber`: This function organizes signals in an object (dictionary) keyed by their numeric identifier. It creates an array with a fixed length (`SIGRTMAX + 1`) to include all signal numbers up to and including `SIGRTMAX` and uses `getSignalByNumber` to fill in the values.

3. **Helper functions**:
   - `getSignalByName`: It takes a signal object as input and returns a tuple for `Object.fromEntries`, using the signal name as the key.
   - `getSignalByNumber`: It finds and returns a signal object by its number, if available, using `findSignalByNumber`.
   - `findSignalByNumber`: It looks up a signal by matching its name against system-defined constants and falls back to matching the number directly against signal descriptions.

Below is the rewritten Node.js code based on the explanation:

```javascript
import { constants } from "node:os";

import { SIGRTMAX } from "./realtime.js";
import { getSignals } from "./signals.js";

const getSignalsByName = () => {
  const signals = getSignals();
  return Object.fromEntries(signals.map(getSignalByName));
};

const getSignalByName = ({
  name,
  number,
  description,
  supported,
  action,
  forced,
  standard
}) => [name, { name, number, description, supported, action, forced, standard }];

export const signalsByName = getSignalsByName();

const getSignalsByNumber = () => {
  const signals = getSignals();
  const length = SIGRTMAX + 1;
  const signalsArray = Array.from({ length }, (value, number) =>
    getSignalByNumber(number, signals)
  );
  return Object.assign({}, ...signalsArray);
};

const getSignalByNumber = (number, signals) => {
  const signal = findSignalByNumber(number, signals);

  if (signal === undefined) {
    return {};
  }

  const { name, description, supported, action, forced, standard } = signal;
  return {
    [number]: {
      name,
      number,
      description,
      supported,
      action,
      forced,
      standard
    }
  };
};

const findSignalByNumber = (number, signals) => {
  const signal = signals.find(({ name }) => constants.signals[name] === number);

  if (signal !== undefined) {
    return signal;
  }

  return signals.find((signalAlt) => signalAlt.number === number);
};

export const signalsByNumber = getSignalsByNumber();
```

The given Node.js code is a module that aggregates and exports functionalities from multiple separate modules. Each module is imported and its exported properties and methods are combined into a single object using the spread operator (...) and then this consolidated object is exported for use in other parts of the application. Specifically, this code exports the functionalities of a promise-based version of the `graceful-fs` library from './fs' and additional methods from other modules like './copy', './empty', './ensure', './json', './mkdirs', './move', './output-file', './path-exists', and './remove'. These modules likely provide extra file system utilities and operations.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const fs = require('./fs');
const copy = require('./copy');
const empty = require('./empty');
const ensure = require('./ensure');
const json = require('./json');
const mkdirs = require('./mkdirs');
const move = require('./move');
const outputFile = require('./output-file');
const pathExists = require('./path-exists');
const remove = require('./remove');

module.exports = {
  ...fs,
  ...copy,
  ...empty,
  ...ensure,
  ...json,
  ...mkdirs,
  ...move,
  ...outputFile,
  ...pathExists,
  ...remove
};
```

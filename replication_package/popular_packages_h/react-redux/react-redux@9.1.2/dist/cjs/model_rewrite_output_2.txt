The given Node.js code is a conditional module export script. It determines which version of a module - specifically React-Redux - to export based on the current environment of the application. If the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to 'production', it exports the minified production version of the React-Redux CommonJS module. Otherwise, it exports the development version of the module, which is likely unminified and includes extra warnings and error messages that aid in debugging during development.

Here is a possible rewritten version of the original Node.js code:

```js
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const modulePath = isProduction ? './react-redux.production.min.cjs' : './react-redux.development.cjs';

module.exports = require(modulePath);
```

The Node.js code is setting up a conditional export for a module based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This is a common practice to optimize code for different environments such as development and production.

- If `NODE_ENV` is set to `'production'`, it exports the minified and optimized production version of the React-Redux library from `react-redux.production.min.cjs`.
- Otherwise, it defaults to exporting the development version from `react-redux.development.cjs`, which is likely unminified and includes additional warnings and debugging information.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const fileName = isProduction ? './react-redux.production.min.cjs' : './react-redux.development.cjs';
module.exports = require(fileName);
```

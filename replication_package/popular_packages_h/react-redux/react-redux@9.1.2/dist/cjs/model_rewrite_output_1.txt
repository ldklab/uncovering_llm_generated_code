The functionality of this Node.js code is to conditionally export a module based on the environment in which the application is running. It checks the value of the environment variable `NODE_ENV`. If it is equal to 'production', it exports a minimized and optimized version of the `react-redux` library suitable for production environments (`react-redux.production.min.cjs`). Otherwise, it exports a development version of the library (`react-redux.development.cjs`) that may include additional warnings and debugging information to aid during development.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const path = isProduction 
  ? './react-redux.production.min.cjs' 
  : './react-redux.development.cjs';

module.exports = require(path);
```

The Node.js code provided is a module that exports various diff and patch-related functionalities. Primarily, it sets up exports for a variety of functions used to compute differences (diffs) between data structures, apply differences (patches), and transform or format these changes. Each export is linked to a corresponding module that provides the actual implementation. These functionalities include character-based diffs, word-based diffs, line-based diffs, CSS diffs, JSON canonicalization and diffs, array diffs, creating and applying patches, and converting changes into different formats such as DMP and XML.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

import _base from "./diff/base";
import { diffChars } from "./diff/character";
import { diffWords, diffWordsWithSpace } from "./diff/word";
import { diffLines, diffTrimmedLines } from "./diff/line";
import { diffSentences } from "./diff/sentence";
import { diffCss } from "./diff/css";
import { diffJson, canonicalize } from "./diff/json";
import { diffArrays } from "./diff/array";
import { applyPatch, applyPatches } from "./patch/apply";
import { parsePatch } from "./patch/parse";
import { merge } from "./patch/merge";
import { reversePatch } from "./patch/reverse";
import { structuredPatch, createTwoFilesPatch, createPatch, formatPatch } from "./patch/create";
import { convertChangesToDMP } from "./convert/dmp";
import { convertChangesToXML } from "./convert/xml";

export {
  _base as Diff,
  applyPatch,
  applyPatches,
  canonicalize,
  convertChangesToDMP,
  convertChangesToXML,
  createPatch,
  createTwoFilesPatch,
  diffArrays,
  diffChars,
  diffCss,
  diffJson,
  diffLines,
  diffSentences,
  diffTrimmedLines,
  diffWords,
  diffWordsWithSpace,
  formatPatch,
  merge,
  parsePatch,
  reversePatch,
  structuredPatch
};
```

This rewrite maintains the import and export structure of the original code, keeping the same module functionalities intact.

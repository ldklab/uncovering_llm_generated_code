The Node.js code provided is a module that exports various functions and classes related to text diffing, patching, and conversion. The "exports" section of the code makes these functionalities available for import in other files. The functionalities include character diffing, word diffing, line diffing, sentence diffing, CSS diffing, JSON diffing, applying patches, parsing patches, merging, and XML conversions among others.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

import Diff from './diff/base';
import { diffChars } from './diff/character';
import { diffWords, diffWordsWithSpace } from './diff/word';
import { diffLines, diffTrimmedLines } from './diff/line';
import { diffSentences } from './diff/sentence';

import { diffCss } from './diff/css';
import { diffJson, canonicalize } from './diff/json';

import { diffArrays } from './diff/array';

import { applyPatch, applyPatches } from './patch/apply';
import { parsePatch } from './patch/parse';
import { merge } from './patch/merge';
import { structuredPatch, createTwoFilesPatch, createPatch } from './patch/create';

import { convertChangesToDMP } from './convert/dmp';
import { convertChangesToXML } from './convert/xml';

export {
  Diff,
  diffChars,
  diffWords,
  diffWordsWithSpace,
  diffLines,
  diffTrimmedLines,
  diffSentences,
  diffCss,
  diffJson,
  canonicalize,
  diffArrays,
  applyPatch,
  applyPatches,
  parsePatch,
  merge,
  structuredPatch,
  createTwoFilesPatch,
  createPatch,
  convertChangesToDMP,
  convertChangesToXML
};
```

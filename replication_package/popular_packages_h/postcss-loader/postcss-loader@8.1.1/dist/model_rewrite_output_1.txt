The Node.js code is a module that exports the default export from the `index` file located in the same directory. This means that whatever is being exported as the default in `index.js` is being re-exported as the main export of the current module. Here's how you could rewrite it:

```javascript
"use strict";

const index = require("./index");
module.exports = index.default;
```

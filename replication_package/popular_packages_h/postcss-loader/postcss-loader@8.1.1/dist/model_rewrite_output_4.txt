The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a default export from another module. The code uses CommonJS syntax to import the default export from a file named `index.js` (found in the same directory) and immediately exports it as the default export for the current module. This essentially reroutes the default export from the `index.js` module to this module.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const index = require("./index");

module.exports = index.default;
```

This version explicitly imports the entire contents from `./index` into a variable named `index`, and then sets `module.exports` to `index.default`. The functionality remains unchanged.

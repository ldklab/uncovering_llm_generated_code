The given Node.js code snippet is a simple module export statement. It is exporting the default export from the module located at the relative path `./index`. This means that whatever is defined as the default export in the `index` module will be made available when this module is imported elsewhere in a project.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");

module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

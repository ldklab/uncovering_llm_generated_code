The given Node.js code is a module export statement. It is importing the default export from a file named `index` located in the same directory and then re-exporting it. This code is essentially facilitating a straightforward re-export, meaning that whatever is the default export in the `index` file will be directly available as the export of this module.

Here is the rewritten code, which retains the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require("./index");
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

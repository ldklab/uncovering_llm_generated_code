The given Node.js code exports a module. It imports the `default` export from a module located in a file named `index` and then re-exports it as the main export of the current module. This setup is often used when you want to simplify or consolidate module exports, especially when reorganizing or restructuring code.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the `default` export from the `index` module.
const defaultExport = require("./index").default;

// Export the module for use in other files.
module.exports = defaultExport;
```

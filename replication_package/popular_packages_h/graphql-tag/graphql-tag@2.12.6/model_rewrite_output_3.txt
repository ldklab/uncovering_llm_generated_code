The Node.js code provided is exporting a specific function, `gql`, from a module file located at `./lib/graphql-tag.umd.js`. The intention behind this export is to maintain backwards compatibility, ensuring that when someone uses `require('graphql-tag')`, they directly get the `gql` function instead of an entire exports object. This is useful when the expected or conventional usage is to directly invoke a function without destructuring an object.

Here's a possible rewrite of the initial code:

```javascript
// Ensure backwards compatibility by returning the gql function from 'graphql-tag'
module.exports = require('./lib/graphql-tag.umd.js').gql;
```

The given Node.js code snippet is used to ensure backward compatibility for the `graphql-tag` package. The code exports the `gql` function from the package's library file (`graphql-tag.umd.js`) directly, so when someone uses `require("graphql-tag")`, they will receive the `gql` function. This approach maintains compatibility for users who expect `require("graphql-tag")` to return the `gql` function rather than an entire exports object.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Ensure backward compatibility by exporting the gql function directly
const gqlFunction = require('./lib/graphql-tag.umd.js').gql;
module.exports = gqlFunction;
```

The provided Node.js code is designed to ensure backward compatibility for users of the `graphql-tag` package. Specifically, when this module is required in other parts of a project using `require("graphql-tag")`, it returns the `gql` function directly, rather than an exports object. The `gql` function is typically used to parse GraphQL query strings.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// Expose the gql function when requiring this module for backward compatibility.
const graphqlTag = require('./lib/graphql-tag.umd.js');
module.exports = graphqlTag.gql;
```

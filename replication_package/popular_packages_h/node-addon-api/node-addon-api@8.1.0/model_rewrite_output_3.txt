The Node.js code is a module that exports an object containing several properties related to file paths and versions for a Node.js addon. It retrieves the package version from a `package.json` file located in the same directory. The module includes:

- **include**: A string representing the current directory's absolute path, marked as deprecated.
- **include_dir**: A relative path from the current working directory to the module's directory.
- **gyp**: A path to a specific target in a `.gyp` file, also marked as deprecated.
- **targets**: A path to a specific target in the `node_addon_api.gyp` file.
- **version**: The current version of the package, as specified in `package.json`.
- **isNodeApiBuiltin**: A boolean indicating if Node API is built-in.
- **needsFlag**: A boolean that seems to signify if a certain condition requires a flag, defaulting to `false`.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { version } = require('./package.json');

const includeDir = path.relative('.', __dirname);

module.exports = {
  include_dir: includeDir,
  targets: path.join(includeDir, 'node_addon_api.gyp'),
  version,
  isNodeApiBuiltin: true,
  needsFlag: false
};
```

The Node.js code is a module that exports a configuration object. This object provides paths to certain necessary files and directories for building native add-ons with Node.js, as well as some metadata. The module makes use of the built-in 'path' module to resolve paths and reads the version from a 'package.json' file in the same directory. Specific fields in the exported object include:

- `include`: Provides a string representation of the current directory path. It is marked as deprecated and planned for removal in version 4.0.0.
- `include_dir`: Provides a relative path from the current working directory to the directory of the module.
- `gyp`: Points to a specific deprecated configuration file path ('node_api.gyp:nothing').
- `targets`: Points to another configuration file ('node_addon_api.gyp') within the directory.
- `version`: The version string obtained from the 'package.json'.
- `isNodeApiBuiltin`: A boolean indicating something related to the built-in Node API (truthy value).
- `needsFlag`: A boolean indicating whether a specific flag is needed (set to false).

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { version } = require('./package.json');

const includeDir = path.relative('.', __dirname);

module.exports = {
  include: `"${__dirname}"`, // deprecated, can be removed as part of 4.0.0
  include_dir: includeDir,
  gyp: path.join(includeDir, 'node_api.gyp:nothing'), // deprecated.
  targets: path.join(includeDir, 'node_addon_api.gyp'),
  version,
  isNodeApiBuiltin: true,
  needsFlag: false
};
```

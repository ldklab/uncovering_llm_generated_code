The provided Node.js code is a module that exports an object containing configuration information related to a node add-on project. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Path and version setup:**
   - The `path` module is imported to handle and transform file paths.
   - The `version` is imported from the `package.json` file, presumably to reflect the version of the project.

2. **Directory information:**
   - `includeDir` is set to the relative path from the current directory to the root of the project directory (`__dirname`).

3. **Exported configuration object:**
   - **include:** A string representing the absolute path of the current directory. It is marked as deprecated and intended for removal in version 4.0.0.
   - **include_dir:** The relative path of the current directory, as calculated above.
   - **gyp:** A path string for a deprecated configuration item related to the node API gyp file.
   - **targets:** A path string pointing to the `node_addon_api.gyp` file, likely specifying build instructions for the node addon.
   - **version:** The version string extracted from `package.json`.
   - **isNodeApiBuiltin:** A boolean indicating whether the Node API is built-in.
   - **needsFlag:** A boolean that may signal whether a special flag is needed for some operations.

Here is the rewritten code encapsulated in a markdown code block:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const { version } = require('./package.json');

const includeDir = path.relative('.', __dirname);

const config = {
  include: `"${__dirname}"`, // deprecated, can be removed as part of 4.0.0
  include_dir: includeDir,
  gyp: path.join(includeDir, 'node_api.gyp:nothing'), // deprecated.
  targets: path.join(includeDir, 'node_addon_api.gyp'),
  version,
  isNodeApiBuiltin: true,
  needsFlag: false
};

module.exports = config;
```

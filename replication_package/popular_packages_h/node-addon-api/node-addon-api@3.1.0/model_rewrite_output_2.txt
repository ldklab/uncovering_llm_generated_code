The functionality of the Node.js code is to create a module that exports an object containing several properties related to the directory path and Node.js API build configurations. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Imports the `path` module**: The code uses Node.js built-in `path` module to handle and transform file paths.
   
2. **Determines `include_dir`**: It calculates the relative path from the current working directory to the directory of the current script file. This results in the `include_dir` being a relative path from where the Node.js process is initiated to where the script resides.

3. **Exports an object**: The module exports an object with the following properties:
   - `include`: A string path to the directory of the current script. The comment indicates this is deprecated and should be removed in a future major version update.
   - `include_dir`: The relative path calculated earlier.
   - `gyp`: A specific path string constructed by appending `node_api.gyp:nothing` to the `include_dir` path. This likely relates to a build configuration file for node-gyp, which is used to compile native add-ons in Node.js.
   - `isNodeApiBuiltin`: A boolean flag set to true, possibly indicating that the Node API is built-in.
   - `needsFlag`: A boolean flag set to false, indicating that some particular flag is not required.

Here's a possible rewrite following the explanation:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const includeDirectory = path.relative(process.cwd(), __dirname);

module.exports = {
  // This line is deprecated and should be removed in version 4.0.0
  include: `"${__dirname}"`,
  include_dir: includeDirectory,
  gyp: path.join(includeDirectory, 'node_api.gyp:nothing'),
  isNodeApiBuiltin: true,
  needsFlag: false
};
```

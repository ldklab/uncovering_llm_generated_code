The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a configuration object. Here's what each part does:

1. **Path Module**: It imports the `path` module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.

2. **include_dir**: This variable calculates a relative path from the current working directory ('.') to the directory name of the current module (`__dirname`). The result is saved in `include_dir`.

3. **Exports Object**: The module exports an object containing several properties:
   - `include`: A string literal that represents the current directory path (`__dirname`). It's marked as deprecated and is suggested to be removed in future version 4.0.0.
   - `include_dir`: The relative path from the current working directory to the module directory, calculated earlier.
   - `gyp`: A string composed by joining `include_dir` with 'node_api.gyp:nothing'. It likely refers to a configuration file used in building code with node-gyp.
   - `isNodeApiBuiltin`: A boolean set to `true`, probably indicating that Node-API is included as a built-in module.
   - `needsFlag`: A boolean set to `false`, possibly determining the requirement of some feature flag.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

const includeDirRelativePath = path.relative('.', __dirname);

module.exports = {
  // Deprecated: Can be removed as part of the 4.0.0 update
  include: `"${__dirname}"`, 
  include_dir: includeDirRelativePath,
  gypFilePath: path.join(includeDirRelativePath, 'node_api.gyp:nothing'),
  isNodeApiBuiltin: true,
  needsFlag: false
};
```

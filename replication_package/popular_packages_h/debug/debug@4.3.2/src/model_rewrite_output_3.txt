The given Node.js code snippet determines the environment in which the script is running and accordingly requires either a browser-specific module or a Node.js-specific module. 

- It checks whether the script is running in an Electron renderer process, NW.js environment, or a browser context. This is discerned by:
  - The absence of the `process` object, which indicates a non-Node.js context.
  - If `process.type` is 'renderer', it indicates an Electron renderer process.
  - If `process.browser` is `true`, it indicates a bundled environment that should be treated like a browser.
  - If `process.__nwjs` is truthy, it suggests the application is running in NW.js.
  
- If any of these conditions are true, it requires and exports the `browser.js` module. Otherwise, it exports the `node.js` module.

Here is a possible rewrite:

```javascript
/**
 * Determine execution environment and require appropriate module.
 * Environment considered as 'browser' if:
 * - process is undefined
 * - process.type is 'renderer' (indicating Electron renderer)
 * - process.browser is true
 * - process.__nwjs is truthy (indicating NW.js)
 */

const isBrowserLikeEnvironment = (typeof process === 'undefined' ||
                                  process.type === 'renderer' ||
                                  process.browser === true ||
                                  process.__nwjs);

module.exports = isBrowserLikeEnvironment ? 
                 require('./browser.js') : 
                 require('./node.js');
```

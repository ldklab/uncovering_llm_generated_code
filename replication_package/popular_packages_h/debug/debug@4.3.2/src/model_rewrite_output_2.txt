The Node.js code is a module that helps to detect the environment in which it is running. Specifically, it determines if the process is being executed within an Electron renderer process or an NW.js context, both of which are environments that allow Node.js functionalities in a browser-like environment. The conditions evaluated in the code are:

1. `typeof process === 'undefined'`: Checks if the `process` object is undefined, which would never be true in a Node.js context but might be in some browser contexts, ensuring compatibility.
2. `process.type === 'renderer'`: Checks if the current process type is 'renderer', which is specific to Electron for renderer processes (i.e., a process running within a web view).
3. `process.browser === true`: Checks if the `process.browser` property is true, indicating a potential NW.js scenario where the script should be treated as a browser context.
4. `process.__nwjs`: Checks for the existence of the `__nwjs` property, which further indicates running within an NW.js process.

Depending on the evaluation of these conditions, the module will export either `./browser.js` or `./node.js`:
- Exports `./browser.js` if the conditions suggest a browser-like environment (Electron or NW.js).
- Exports `./node.js` if none of the conditions are met and a typical Node.js server environment is detected.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
/**
 * Detects if the environment is an Electron renderer process, a NW.js process, or a typical Node.js process,
 * exporting browser-specific or node-specific modules accordingly.
 */

const isBrowserLikeEnvironment = (typeof process === 'undefined') ||
                                 (process.type === 'renderer') ||
                                 (process.browser === true) ||
                                 (process.__nwjs);

module.exports = isBrowserLikeEnvironment ? require('./browser.js') : require('./node.js');

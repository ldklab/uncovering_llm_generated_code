The function of this Node.js code is to determine the current environment in which the script is running and export different modules accordingly. The code checks if it is running in an Electron renderer process or a NW.js (Node-Webkit) environment, which are considered browser environments despite having access to Node.js. Here are the conditions being checked:

1. If `process` is undefined, it indicates a non-Node.js environment, indicative of a browser-like situation.
2. If `process.type` is 'renderer', it means the code is running in an Electron renderer process.
3. If `process.browser` is `true`, it suggests the code is being executed in a browser environment, often set manually in settings.
4. If `process.__nwjs` is `true`, it implies that the script is running within a NW.js application.

When any of these conditions are true, the script exports the module intended for browser environments (`./browser.js`). If none of these conditions apply, it assumes a regular Node.js environment and exports the module intended for Node.js environments (`./node.js`).

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const isElectronRenderer = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.type === 'renderer';
const isBrowserProcess = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.browser === true;
const isNWJSProcess = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.__nwjs;

if (typeof process === 'undefined' || isElectronRenderer || isBrowserProcess || isNWJSProcess) {
  module.exports = require('./browser.js');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./node.js');
}
```

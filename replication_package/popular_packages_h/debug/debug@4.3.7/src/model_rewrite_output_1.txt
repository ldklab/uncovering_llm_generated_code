The provided Node.js code snippet is used to determine whether the current environment is a browser environment provided by Electron or NW.js, or a standard Node.js environment. It does this by checking specific properties of the `process` object:

1. If `process` is undefined, it implies a browser-like environment as Node.js always has a `process` object.
2. If `process.type` is 'renderer', it indicates an Electron renderer process.
3. If `process.browser` is true, it suggests a browser-like environment or Electron.
4. If `process.__nwjs` is true, it means it is running in an NW.js environment.

If any of these conditions hold true, it requires and exports functionalities from the `browser.js` module, meaning the code is running in a browser-like environment. If none of these conditions are met, it exports the `node.js` module, indicating that it is running in a standard Node.js environment.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code:

```javascript
const isBrowserEnvironment = () => (
  typeof process === 'undefined' ||
  process.type === 'renderer' ||
  process.browser === true ||
  process.__nwjs
);

module.exports = isBrowserEnvironment() ? require('./browser.js') : require('./node.js');
```

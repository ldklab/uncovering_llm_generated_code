The given Node.js code is designed to set up and export a polyfill function. This polyfill function is created by calling the `callBind` function on the result of invoking `getPolyfill()`, with `Object` as the context. The code also uses `define-properties` to attach extra properties to this polyfill function, specifically `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`. These properties refer to the respective required modules, making the functionality of these modules accessible through the polyfill.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

defineProperties(polyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

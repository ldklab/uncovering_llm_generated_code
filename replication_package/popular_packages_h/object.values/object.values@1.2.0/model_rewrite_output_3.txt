The provided Node.js code is a module that sets up and exports a "polyfill" with additional properties. The steps it follows are:

1. It uses `require` to import necessary modules:
   - `define-properties` is used to define properties on an object.
   - `call-bind` is used to bind methods to an object.
   - The local modules './implementation', './polyfill', and './shim' are also imported.

2. The `getPolyfill` function is called and its result is bound to the `Object` using `callBind`, resulting in a `polyfill` function.

3. `define` is used to augment the `polyfill` object with three properties:
   - `getPolyfill`: A reference to the `getPolyfill` function.
   - `implementation`: A reference to the `implementation` module.
   - `shim`: A reference to the `shim` module.

4. Finally, the `polyfill` object, now augmented with additional properties, is exported from the module.

```javascript
'use strict';

const define = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

define(polyfill, {
	getPolyfill,
	implementation,
	shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

The given Node.js code defines and exports a polyfill function with additional properties and methods. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Imports Required Modules**:
   - `define-properties`: Used to define properties with specific attributes on an object.
   - `call-bind`: Provides a method to bind a function to a particular context.
   - Custom local modules: These include 'implementation', 'polyfill', and 'shim', which are presumably files in the same directory directory.

2. **Creates a Polyfill Function**:
   - The `getPolyfill` function is first executed and the result is bound to the `Object` context using `callBind`. The resulting function (hereafter referred to as `polyfill`) will thus be available with its capabilities adjusted to the `Object` context.

3. **Extends the Polyfill with Additional Methods**:
   - `define-properties` is used to add three properties to the `polyfill` function:
     - `getPolyfill`: References the `getPolyfill` function, enabling users to retrieve the polyfill logic manually.
     - `implementation`: Exposes the raw implementation logic of the feature being polyfilled.
     - `shim`: Provides a method for applying the polyfill to the environment, typically replacing native behavior if lacking or outdated.

4. **Exports the Polyfill**:
   - Finally, the `polyfill` function, now enhanced with additional properties, is exported as the module's main export.

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');
const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

defineProperties(polyfill, {
	getPolyfill,
	implementation,
	shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

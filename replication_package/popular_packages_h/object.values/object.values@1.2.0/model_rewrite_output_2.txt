The given Node.js code is setting up a polyfill module for some functionality. Let's break down what this code does:

1. **Dependencies Import**: 
   - It uses `define-properties` which is a module that makes it easy to define properties on objects with specific descriptors.
   - `call-bind` is imported, which is a module used to call-bind methods with a specific `this` context.
   - Three local modules are imported: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`.

2. **Polyfill Creation**:
   - A polyfill, which is a code providing modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it, is created using the `callBind` function. It binds the `getPolyfill()` method with `Object`, allowing it to be invoked as a method on the `Object`.

3. **Define Properties**:
   - The `define` function sets up additional properties on the `polyfill` function. Additional properties added are:
     - `getPolyfill`: a reference to the imported `getPolyfill` function.
     - `implementation`: a reference to the `implementation` function.
     - `shim`: a reference to the `shim` function.

4. **Exports**:
   - The `polyfill` function, now equipped with additional properties, is exported as the module's interface.

The rewritten code version of the above Node.js module is the following:

```javascript
'use strict';

var defineProperties = require('define-properties');
var bind = require('call-bind');

var implementationModule = require('./implementation');
var polyfillFunction = require('./polyfill');
var shimFunction = require('./shim');

var boundPolyfill = bind(polyfillFunction(), Object);

defineProperties(boundPolyfill, {
	getPolyfill: polyfillFunction,
	implementation: implementationModule,
	shim: shimFunction
});

module.exports = boundPolyfill;
```

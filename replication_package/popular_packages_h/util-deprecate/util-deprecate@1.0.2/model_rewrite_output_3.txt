The given Node.js code is a module that exports the `deprecate` function from Node.js's built-in `util` module. The `util.deprecate` function is typically used to mark a function as deprecated, meaning it is outdated and may be removed in future versions. When the deprecated function is invoked, it issues a warning to inform the developer that the function is deprecated.

Rewritten code:

```javascript
// This module exports the `deprecate` method from Node.js's native `util` module.
// The `deprecate` function is used to mark certain functions as deprecated.
const { deprecate } = require('util');

module.exports = deprecate;
```

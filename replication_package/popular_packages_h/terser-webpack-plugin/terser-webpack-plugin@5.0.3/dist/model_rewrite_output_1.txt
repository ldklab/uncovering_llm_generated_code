The provided Node.js code exports a default module from another file named 'index'. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. The code uses the `"use strict";` directive to enable strict mode, which helps catch common coding errors and unsafe actions in JavaScript.

2. It imports a module named `plugin` from a file located in the same directory, denoted by `'./index'`.

3. The `plugin.default` property is exported as the module's output. This assumes that the imported module uses `ES6 module` syntax and has a `default` export.

Below is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const plugin = require('./index');

module.exports = plugin.default;
```

The provided Node.js code exports a default module from a local file named `index.js`. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. `"use strict";` — This line enables strict mode, which helps in catching common coding errors and "unsafe" actions like defining global variables unintentionally.

2. `const plugin = require('./index');` — This line imports the module located in the `index.js` file within the same directory and assigns it to the constant `plugin`.

3. `module.exports = plugin.default;` — This line exports the default export of the module imported from `index.js`. This implies that the `index.js` module exports an object or a function where a `default` property exists, and this property is being exported as the main export of the current module.

Below is a possible rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require('./index');

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

The provided Node.js code snippet is exporting a module from another file. Here's what the code does step-by-step:

1. It begins with the directive `"use strict";`, which enables strict mode in JavaScript. This mode helps catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions by throwing errors.

2. The code imports a module using `require('./index');`. This imports whatever is exported from the `index.js` file located in the same directory.

3. Finally, `module.exports = plugin.default;` sets the default export from the imported module to be the export of the current module. This suggests that `index.js` likely exports an object with a `default` property, and the code is re-exporting this default value.

Given this explanation, here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexModule = require('./index');

module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The Node.js code is a simple module export. It requires a module located in a file named `index` and then exports the default export from this module. This pattern is commonly used when you want to re-export a module's main functionality from a different entry point.

Here's a possible rewrite:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

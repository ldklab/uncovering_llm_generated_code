The provided Node.js code is a module that exports an array of strings. Each string in the array represents the name of a Typed Array constructor available in JavaScript. These Typed Arrays are used for creating and managing binary data in memory. The list includes constructors for various types of integer and floating-point arrays, as well as their big integer counterparts.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Module exporting an array of Typed Array constructor names as strings
module.exports = [
    'Float32Array',
    'Float64Array',
    'Int8Array',
    'Int16Array',
    'Int32Array',
    'Uint8Array',
    'Uint8ClampedArray',
    'Uint16Array',
    'Uint32Array',
    'BigInt64Array',
    'BigUint64Array'
];
```

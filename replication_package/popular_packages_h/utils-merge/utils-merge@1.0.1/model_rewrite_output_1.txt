The Node.js code provides a utility function that merges two objects. Specifically, it takes two objects as parameters—`a` and `b`—and copies all key-value pairs from object `b` into object `a`. The function then returns the modified object `a` which now includes all of its original key-value pairs, plus those from `b`. If either `a` or `b` is not provided or is falsy, no merging occurs.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code using modern JavaScript syntax:

```javascript
/**
 * Merge object b with object a.
 *
 *     let a = { foo: 'bar' }
 *     let b = { bar: 'baz' };
 *
 *     merge(a, b);
 *     // => { foo: 'bar', bar: 'baz' }
 *
 * @param {Object} a
 * @param {Object} b
 * @return {Object}
 * @api public
 */

module.exports = function merge(a, b) {
  if (a && b) {
    Object.assign(a, b);
  }
  return a;
};
```

In this rewritten version:
- We use `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations in the examples, which is more modern and has block scope.
- The function is named `merge` for clearer semantics.
- We use `Object.assign()` to copy the properties from `b` to `a`, which is a standard method for shallow copying properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- `module.exports` is directly assigned the function, as `exports = module.exports =` can be ambiguous in some contexts.

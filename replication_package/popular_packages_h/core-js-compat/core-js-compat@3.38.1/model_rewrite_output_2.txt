The provided Node.js code is designed to import various module functionalities from individual files and amalgamate them into a single export object. This is achieved by using `Object.assign` to merge different modules into a comprehensive object that is then exported. The exported object contains several properties: `compat`, `data`, `entries`, `getModulesListForTargetVersion`, and `modules`. Each of these properties refers to a module imported from a corresponding file. Additionally, the `compat` module is included both as a property and directly merged into the export object for extended compatibility or functionality.

Here is a rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const compat = require('./compat');
const data = require('./data');
const entries = require('./entries');
const getModulesListForTargetVersion = require('./get-modules-list-for-target-version');
const modules = require('./modules');

module.exports = {
  compat: Object.assign({}, compat),
  data,
  entries,
  getModulesListForTargetVersion,
  modules,
};
```

The functionality of the Node.js code is to export a module from another file so that it can be used in other parts of the application. In this case, it exports whatever is defined in `./src/table`. By using `module.exports`, whatever is defined in `./src/table` is made available to be imported and used in other files within the project or application.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const table = require('./src/table');
module.exports = table;
```

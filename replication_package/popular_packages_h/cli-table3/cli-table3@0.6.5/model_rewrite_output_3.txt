The given Node.js code exports a module by loading and requiring another module located at the path `./src/table`. This means any functionality, methods, or objects defined and exported in the `table` module will be accessible to other parts of the application that imports this module. It is a common pattern to create concise and organized entry points for modules within a project.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const table = require('./src/table');
module.exports = table;
```

The original Node.js code exports a module from a file located at `./src/table`. This means that when another file imports from this module, it will get whatever is exported from the `table.js` file located in the `src` directory. 

Below is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```js
// file: index.js
const tableModule = require('./src/table');

module.exports = tableModule;
```

In this rewritten version:
- We are explicitly storing the required module from `./src/table` into a constant named `tableModule`.
- Then, we export `tableModule`. This accomplishes the same functionality as the original code by making it clear that `tableModule` is what is being re-exported.

The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports the contents from a file located at `./src/table`. When this module is required elsewhere in the application, it will load whatever is exported from the `table.js` file located in the `src` directory relative to the current file.

Here's a possible rewrite that achieves the same functionality:

```javascript
const tableModule = require('./src/table');

module.exports = tableModule;
```

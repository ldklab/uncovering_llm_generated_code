The functionality of the given Node.js code is quite simple. It exports a module from a file located at `./src/table`. This means when this module is imported elsewhere in the project, it provides whatever is exported from the `table` module located in the `src` directory. 

Here's a rewritten version of the code with the same functionality: 

```javascript
const tableModule = require('./src/table');
module.exports = tableModule;
```

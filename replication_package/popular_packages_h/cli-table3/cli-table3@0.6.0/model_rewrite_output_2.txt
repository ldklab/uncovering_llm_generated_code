The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export the module that is located in the './src/table' file. By doing this, any other file that imports this module will directly access whatever is defined and exported in './src/table'. This pattern is often used to re-export a module from another path, providing a simpler or cleaner entry point for the module consumers.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
const tableModule = require('./src/table');

module.exports = tableModule;
```

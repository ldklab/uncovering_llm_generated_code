The provided Node.js code is a module export statement. It exports whatever is returned from requiring the './src/table' module. Basically, it allows the current module to act as a wrapper or forwarding module that re-exports the functionality or content from the './src/table' file. This makes it easier for other parts of the application to import functionality from './src/table' directly from this module. 

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const table = require('./src/table');

module.exports = table;
```

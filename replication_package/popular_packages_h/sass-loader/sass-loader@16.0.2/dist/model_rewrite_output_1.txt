The provided Node.js code is a simple module loader. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Strict Mode**: The code begins with `"use strict";` which is a directive to enable strict mode. Strict mode helps catch common coding bugs and prevents certain actions, like assigning to undefined variables.

2. **Load Module**: The code imports a module located in the same directory named `index`. It uses the `require` function to load this module.

3. **Export Default**: The module exports the default export from the `index` module. This means that whatever is specified as the default export in `index.js` will be the export of this module too.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");
module.exports = defaultExport;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module that utilizes the CommonJS module system. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It imports a module located in a file named `index` using the `require` function. This imports whatever is exported from the `index.js` file, typically the main file of a directory-based module.

2. It then re-exports the `default` property of the imported `loader` module. This is likely done to expose a specific part of the module, similar to how ES6's default exports work, but using the CommonJS system instead.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code, maintaining the functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const loaderModule = require("./index");
module.exports = loaderModule.default;
```

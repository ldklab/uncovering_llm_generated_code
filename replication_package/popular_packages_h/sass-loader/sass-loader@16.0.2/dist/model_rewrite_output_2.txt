The given Node.js code serves a simple purpose. It imports a module named `loader` from a file `index.js` located in the same directory. After importing, it then exports the `default` property of the imported `loader` module. This is commonly seen in environments where ES6 modules are compiled down to CommonJS syntax, and the `default` export needs to be specifically handled to match ES6 import/export behavior.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");
module.exports = defaultExport;
```

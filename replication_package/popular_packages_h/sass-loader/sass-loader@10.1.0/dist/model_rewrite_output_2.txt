The Node.js code is performing the following actions:

1. The "use strict"; directive is enforcing strict mode which helps in catching common coding mistakes and unsafe actions such as defining global variables.

2. It requires a file/module named `index` located in the same directory as the current file. This is stored in a constant called `loader`.

3. It then exports the default export from the `loader` module. This means that when another file imports this module, it will receive whatever is the `default` export from the `index` module.

Below is the rewritten code maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const loader = require("./index");

module.exports = loader.default;
```

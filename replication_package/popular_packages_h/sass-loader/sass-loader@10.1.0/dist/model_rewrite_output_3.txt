The Node.js code provided is a module file that likely functions as part of a larger codebase. Here's how it works:

1. **Strict Mode**: The line `"use strict";` at the top ensures that the code is executed in strict mode. It helps catch common mistakes and unsafe actions such as defining variables without declaring them.

2. **Require a Module**: The code imports the contents of a module called `./index` using the `require` function, assigning it to a constant named `loader`. This means that `loader` will hold whatever is exported from the `./index` file.

3. **Module Export**: The last line exports a specific portion of the imported module. It sets the `default` property of `loader` as the export of the current module. This means that when another file imports this module, it will receive whatever `loader.default` contains.

The main functionality here is to act as a bridge, exporting the `default` export from the `./index` module.

Here is a possible rewritten version:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

The provided Node.js code is performing the following tasks:

1. It uses the "strict mode" JavaScript feature, which helps catch common coding errors and safeguards against certain problematic language features.

2. The code imports a module, likely found in a local file named `index.js` or a folder named `index` that includes an `index.js` file, and assigns it to the constant `loader`.

3. It then exports the default property of the `loader` module. This is typically used when the `index.js` file exports a function or class as the default export, making it directly accessible when the module is imported elsewhere.

Here is the possible rewrite of the Node.js code based on this understanding:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: loaderDefault } = require("./index");

module.exports = loaderDefault;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module that imports functionality from another module named `index` in the same directory and then exports the default export of that `index` module. 

Here's a clearer step-by-step explanation:

1. The code has `"use strict";` at the start, which enforces strict mode for more rigorous error-checking during execution.
2. It imports a module called `index` using `require("./index");` and assigns it to a constant named `loader`.
3. The module exported by `index` could have multiple exports, but this code specifically exports the default export of the `index` module with `module.exports = loader.default;`.

A possible rewrite of this code could be as follows:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

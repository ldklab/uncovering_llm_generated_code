The provided Node.js code is using CommonJS modules and TypeScript to organize and export functionalities from different internal files or modules in a structured manner. It's a module index file that imports various modules and their components, then exports them for use in other parts of an application. This code is typically found in a library where numerous functionalities and utilities need to be made available to developers.

Here's a more organized rewrite of the code using modern JavaScript (ES6+):

```javascript
"use strict";

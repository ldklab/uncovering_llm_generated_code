The provided Node.js code defines a module that exports a function named `createTransformer`. This function instantiates and returns a new object from the `TsJestTransformer` class, which is imported from a module named `ts-jest-transformer`. The `use strict` directive at the top of the file ensures that the code is executed in strict mode, which helps in catching common coding errors.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";
class TsJestTransformer {
    // Assume some constructor and methods are defined here
}

function createTransformer() {
    return new TsJestTransformer();
}

module.exports = { createTransformer };
```

The Node.js code is exporting a bound function which is a modified version of the `implementation` function. This function is bound using `callBind`, meaning it is called with a specific value for `this`. Additionally, the code uses `define-properties` to attach three additional properties to the bound function: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`. These properties allow anyone using the exported function to also access the polyfill and the original functions as part of the utility module.

```javascript
'use strict';

const define = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const bound = callBind(implementation);

define(bound, {
	getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
	implementation: implementation,
	shim: shim
});

module.exports = bound;
```

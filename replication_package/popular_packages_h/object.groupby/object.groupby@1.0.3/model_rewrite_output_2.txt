The Node.js code is creating a module that provides a polyfilled or shimmed version of a specific function or method for the `Object` type. The code does the following:

1. It imports necessary functions and objects from other modules:
   - `define-properties` is used to define properties on an object.
   - `call-bind` is used to bind a function to an object.
   - `./implementation`, `./polyfill`, and `./shim` are likely custom modules that provide the respective functionalities.

2. It retrieves a polyfill method by calling `getPolyfill()` and binds this polyfill method to the `Object` using `callBind`.

3. The bound function is then enhanced by adding properties like `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`, allowing users of this module to access additional information or functionalities related to the polyfilled method.

4. Finally, it exports the bound function with the additional properties as the module's main export.

Below is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const polyfill = getPolyfill();
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundFunction = callBind(polyfill, Object);

defineProperties(boundFunction, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = boundFunction;
```

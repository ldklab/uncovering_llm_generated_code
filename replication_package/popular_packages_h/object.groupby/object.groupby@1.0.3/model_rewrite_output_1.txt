The Node.js code is a module that sets up and exports a function which is constructed by binding the polyfill function to the Object. It uses several external dependencies: `define-properties` for defining properties on the exported function, `call-bind` for creating a bound function, and three local modules: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`. The exported function, `bound`, includes additional properties: `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`.

The polyfill function is retrieved and potentially modified using a method called `getPolyfill` from the `./polyfill`. This polyfill is then bound to the global `Object` constructor using the `callBind` utility. The `shim` is expected to be a method that applies or installs the polyfill if necessary.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const polyfillFunction = getPolyfill();
const boundFunction = callBind(polyfillFunction, Object);

defineProperties(boundFunction, {
    getPolyfill,
    implementation,
    shim
});

module.exports = boundFunction;
```

The given Node.js code is a module that exports the functionality found in a file named `http-proxy` located in a subdirectory called `lib`. This essentially means that when this module is required by another file, it will provide whatever is exported by `lib/http-proxy`. This could include a variety of functions, classes, or objects that deal with HTTP proxying.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
/**
 * Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
 * Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
 * Beats with his oar whoever lags behind
 *
 *          Dante - The Divine Comedy (Canto III)
 */

// Export the http-proxy module from the lib directory
module.exports = require('./lib/http-proxy');
```

The Node.js code provided is a simple module export statement. It exports the contents or functionalities defined in a file located at `./lib/http-proxy` from the current module. When this module is imported elsewhere, it will expose whatever is defined inside `http-proxy.js` in the `lib` directory. This is a common practice in Node.js to organize and modularize code, making it easier to manage and reuse.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// This module exports the functionalities from the 'http-proxy' module located in the 'lib' directory.

module.exports = require('./lib/http-proxy');
```

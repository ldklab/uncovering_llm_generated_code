The Node.js code is a module export statement. It is part of a Node.js module system convention, where the module exports an interface to be used in other files. In this case, it is exporting whatever is defined in `./lib/http-proxy`, which likely refers to another JavaScript module file located in a subdirectory named `lib`. This allows the functionality defined in `http-proxy.js` to be accessible when this module is imported elsewhere in a Node.js application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the provided code:

```javascript
// Dante's The Divine Comedy quote used as a comment or annotation

// Exporting the module found in './lib/http-proxy'
// This allows other files to use the functionality defined in http-proxy.js
const httpProxy = require('./lib/http-proxy');

module.exports = httpProxy;
```

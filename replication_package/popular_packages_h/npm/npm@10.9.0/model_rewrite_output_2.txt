The given Node.js code checks if the current module is the main module. If it is the main module (indicating that the script is run directly from the command line and not required by another module), it imports a function from `./lib/cli.js` and calls it with the `process` object as an argument. If the module is not the main one (i.e., it is being imported into another module), it throws an error indicating that the programmatic API was removed in npm version 8.0.0.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const executeIfMain = () => {
  const isMainModule = require.main === module;

  if (isMainModule) {
    const cli = require('./lib/cli.js');
    cli(process);
  } else {
    throw new Error('The programmatic API was removed in npm v8.0.0');
  }
};

executeIfMain();
```

The Node.js code is used to determine the context in which the current module is being executed. It checks if the script is being run directly from the command line or is being required as a module in another script. Here's how it works:

- `require.main === module`: This condition checks if the current module is the entry point to the application. It evaluates to `true` if the script is executed directly from the command line and not imported as a module in another file.
- If the condition is `true`, it means the script is being run directly, and it proceeds to require and execute a function from './lib/cli.js', passing the `process` object to it. This typically involves running some command-line interface logic defined in 'cli.js'.
- If the script is imported as a module (`require.main !== module`), it throws an error indicating that the programmatic API (using this script as a module) has been removed as of npm version 8.0.0.

Here's the rewritten version of the code, preserving the explained functionality:

```javascript
const isDirectlyRun = () => require.main === module;

const executeCli = () => {
  try {
    require('./lib/cli.js')(process);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error executing CLI:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

const checkAndRun = () => {
  if (isDirectlyRun()) {
    executeCli();
  } else {
    throw new Error('The programmatic API was removed in npm v8.0.0');
  }
};

checkAndRun();
```

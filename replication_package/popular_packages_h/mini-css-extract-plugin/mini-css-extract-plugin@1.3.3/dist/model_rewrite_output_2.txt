The provided Node.js code is a module that exports the default export from another module, located in the `index.js` file. This means that whatever is set as the default export in `index.js` is made available when this module is imported elsewhere in the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the default export from './index' module
const defaultExport = require('./index').default;

// Export it as the default export of this module
module.exports = defaultExport;
```

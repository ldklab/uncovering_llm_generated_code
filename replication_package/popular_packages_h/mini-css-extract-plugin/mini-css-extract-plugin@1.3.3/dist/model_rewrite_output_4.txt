The original Node.js code exports the default export from the module located at './index'. The "use strict" directive ensures that the code runs in strict mode, which is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, leading to more secure and optimized functioning.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const indexModule = require('./index');

module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

The code is leveraging Node.js's module system to export a specific part of a module. It imports the 'default' export from a module located at './index' and immediately exports it. This pattern is typical when you want to re-export part of another module, possibly to simplify the export statement in another file or to streamline importing in other parts of the application.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const indexDefault = require('./index').default;

module.exports = indexDefault;
```

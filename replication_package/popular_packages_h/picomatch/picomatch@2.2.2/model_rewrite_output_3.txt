The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It imports and re-exports a module from the path './lib/picomatch'. By doing this, any code that imports this file will receive the functionality provided by the 'picomatch' module. This pattern is commonly used to create a single entry point for a module, hiding the internal file structure.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the picomatch module from the specified path
const picomatch = require('./lib/picomatch');

// Export the imported picomatch module to make its functionalities available for other modules to use
module.exports = picomatch;
```

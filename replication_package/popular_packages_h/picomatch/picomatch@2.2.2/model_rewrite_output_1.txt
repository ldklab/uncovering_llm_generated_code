The given Node.js code is using the module system to export functionality from another file. It is setting up a CommonJS module by using `module.exports` to expose the contents of a file named `picomatch` that is located in the `lib` directory. This implies that there is a `picomatch.js` file that includes certain logic or functionalities which should be accessible to other parts of the application that import this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the provided code, maintaining the same functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

const picomatch = require('./lib/picomatch');

module.exports = picomatch;
```

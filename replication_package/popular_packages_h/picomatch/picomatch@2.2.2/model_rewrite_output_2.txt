The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. It exports whatever is being exported from the `./lib/picomatch` module. This typically means that the functionality or objects that are defined in the `picomatch` module located in the `lib` directory will be directly accessible through this module when it is required or imported elsewhere in the application. This is a common pattern used to simplify access to modules or to re-export modules under a different path.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Export all functionalities from the 'picomatch' module located in the 'lib' directory.
module.exports = require('./lib/picomatch');
```

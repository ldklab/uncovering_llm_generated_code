The Node.js code is a module that exports the functionality from a file named `picomatch.js` located in the `lib` directory. The `require` function loads this file, and the `module.exports` statement makes whatever is exported from `picomatch.js` available to other files that import this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the picomatch module from the lib directory
const picomatch = require('./lib/picomatch');

// Export the imported picomatch module
module.exports = picomatch;
```

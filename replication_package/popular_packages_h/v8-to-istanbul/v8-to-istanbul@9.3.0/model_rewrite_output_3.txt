The Node.js code is a module that exports a single function. This function, when called, creates and returns a new instance of the `V8ToIstanbul` class. The `V8ToIstanbul` class is required from a local module located in './lib/v8-to-istanbul'. The function takes four parameters: `path`, `wrapperLength`, `sources`, and `excludePath`, which are then passed to the `V8ToIstanbul` constructor, presumably to configure or initialize the instance based on these inputs. 

Here's a rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
const V8ToIstanbul = require('./lib/v8-to-istanbul');

function createV8ToIstanbulInstance(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath) {
  return new V8ToIstanbul(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath);
}

module.exports = createV8ToIstanbulInstance;
```

The given Node.js code is a module that exports a single function. This function acts as a factory for creating instances of the `V8ToIstanbul` class using the specified constructor parameters. The `V8ToIstanbul` module is expected to be imported from a file located in the `lib` directory. The parameters for the function include:

- `path`: A string representing a file path.
- `wrapperLength`: Likely a number that could represent some length requirement for the wrapper.
- `sources`: Possibly an array or object containing the source code or definitions.
- `excludePath`: A string or pattern to exclude certain paths from processing.

Here is the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const V8ToIstanbul = require('./lib/v8-to-istanbul');

function createV8ToIstanbulInstance(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath) {
  return new V8ToIstanbul(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath);
}

module.exports = createV8ToIstanbulInstance;
```

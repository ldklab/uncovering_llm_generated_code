The provided Node.js code is exporting a module function. It imports a module named `V8ToIstanbul` from a file located at `./lib/v8-to-istanbul`. The exported function takes four parameters: `path`, `wrapperLength`, `sources`, and `excludePath`. When called, it creates and returns a new instance of the `V8ToIstanbul` class (or function, depending on the implementation) by passing the received arguments to its constructor. This function serves as a factory for creating instances of `V8ToIstanbul` with the provided arguments.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const V8ToIstanbul = require('./lib/v8-to-istanbul');

function createV8ToIstanbulInstance(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath) {
  return new V8ToIstanbul(path, wrapperLength, sources, excludePath);
}

module.exports = createV8ToIstanbulInstance;
```

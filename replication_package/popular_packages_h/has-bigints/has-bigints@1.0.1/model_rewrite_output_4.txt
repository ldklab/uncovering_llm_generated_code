The Node.js code defines a module that exports a function called `hasNativeBigInts`. This function checks if the JavaScript environment (specifically Node.js in this case) has native support for `BigInt`, which is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.

Here is what the function does:

1. It first assigns the global `BigInt` object to a variable `$BigInt`.
2. It then returns the result of several checks:
   - It checks if `$BigInt` and `BigInt` are both of type `function`. This is to ensure that `BigInt` is a defined and callable function in the environment.
   - It creates a `BigInt` instance using the number 42 (the presence of such a number is just a test to see if the creation is successful) with both `$BigInt(42)` and `BigInt(42)`, and checks if their types are `'bigint'`.

If all these conditions are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that native `BigInt` support exists in the environment. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

```javascript
'use strict';

const hasNativeBigInts = () => {
    try {
        const $BigInt = BigInt;
        return typeof $BigInt === 'function'
            && typeof BigInt === 'function'
            && typeof $BigInt(42) === 'bigint'
            && typeof BigInt(42) === 'bigint';
    } catch (e) {
        return false;
    }
};

module.exports = hasNativeBigInts;
```

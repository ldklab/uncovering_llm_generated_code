The functionality of this Node.js code is to check whether the environment natively supports BigInt, a relatively new primitive type in JavaScript used for representing whole numbers larger than the maximum safe integer limit for the Number type. The function `hasNativeBigInts` performs several checks to confirm the presence of native BigInt support:

1. It ensures that the `BigInt` variable in the global scope is of the type 'function'.
2. It checks that both `$BigInt` (a reference to the global BigInt) and `BigInt` can be used as functions to construct a BigInt object.
3. It verifies that creating a BigInt using the number 42 returns a value of type 'bigint', ensuring that both `$BigInt` and the global `BigInt` produce values correctly.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code according to the explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const globalBigInt = global.BigInt;

function checkNativeBigIntSupport() {
	return typeof globalBigInt === 'function'
		&& typeof BigInt === 'function'
		&& typeof globalBigInt(42) === 'bigint'
		&& typeof BigInt(42) === 'bigint';
}

module.exports = checkNativeBigIntSupport;
```

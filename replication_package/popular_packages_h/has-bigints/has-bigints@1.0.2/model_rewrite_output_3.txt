The Node.js code is a module that checks if the current JavaScript environment supports native BigInt types, which are used for representing arbitrarily large integers. 

- The code first checks if the `BigInt` type is defined using `typeof BigInt !== 'undefined'` and assigns it to the variable `$BigInt`. This check is crucial because the BigInt type might not be available in all JavaScript environments, especially older versions.
- The exported function `hasNativeBigInts` performs several checks to confirm the presence of native BigInt support:
  1. It verifies if `$BigInt` is a function, which confirms the initial check.
  2. It rechecks if `BigInt` is a function directly.
  3. It creates a BigInt with the value `42` using both `$BigInt` and `BigInt` and ensures the type of the result is `'bigint'`.
- If all these checks pass, it returns `true`, indicating the environment has full support for native BigInts; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const isBigIntSupported = typeof BigInt !== 'undefined';

module.exports = function hasNativeBigInts() {
	if (!isBigIntSupported) {
		return false;
	}

	// Create a BigInt to verify its typeof
	const exampleBigInt = BigInt(42); // eslint-disable-line no-magic-numbers

	return typeof BigInt === 'function' && typeof exampleBigInt === 'bigint';
};
```

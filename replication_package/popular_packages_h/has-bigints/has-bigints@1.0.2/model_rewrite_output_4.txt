The given Node.js code defines a function `hasNativeBigInts`, which checks for the presence of native `BigInt` support in the JavaScript environment. The code does the following:

1. It assigns `BigInt` to a variable `$BigInt` if `BigInt` is defined in the environment.
2. The `hasNativeBigInts` function checks:
   - That `$BigInt` is a function, confirming that `BigInt` was indeed defined.
   - That `BigInt` itself is a function for further assurance.
   - That creating a `BigInt` from the number `42` results in a value of type `'bigint'` when using both `$BigInt` and `BigInt` directly.
3. If all these conditions are true, it returns `true`, indicating native support for `BigInt` exists; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```js
'use strict';

const hasNativeBigInts = () => {
    if (typeof BigInt === 'undefined') return false;

    const testValue = 42n; // using a BigInt literal here

    return typeof BigInt === 'function' && typeof testValue === 'bigint';
};

module.exports = hasNativeBigInts;
```

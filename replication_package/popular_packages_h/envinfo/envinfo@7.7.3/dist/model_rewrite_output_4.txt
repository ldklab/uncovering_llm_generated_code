The provided Node.js code is a complex script used to gather and organize information about a system's software and environment. This script seems to be part of a package that detects and outputs details about the operating system, installed software, hardware, and development tools, formatted in various ways (e.g., JSON, Markdown, YAML). It includes the following functionalities:

1. **Module Loader:** It begins with a module loader implementation. It handles module imports from a function-based system, caches them to optimize performance, and provides helper functions for defining new modules and handling exports.

2. **Glob Patterns and File Handling:** It uses several Node.js modules (`path`, `fs`, `child_process`) to handle file paths, read/write files, and execute subprocesses. It also uses patterns to search and match file paths (common in package managers and build tools).

3. **System and Software Detection:** The script includes various functions to detect installed software packages and tools (like Node.js, npm, various IDEs, and SDKs). It runs shell commands to fetch version numbers and paths.

4. **Platform-Specific Handling:** It differentiates between operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to run OS-specific commands and system checks.

5. **Formatting Utilities:** After collecting system information, it can output this data in different formats (JSON, Markdown, YAML). It has utilities for cleaning and structuring the output, applying formatting like indentation and headers.

6. **Promises and Asynchronous Handling:** The script uses promises to handle asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth execution without blocking the main thread. 

7. **Environment Information Access:** It may use package.json files to identify globally installed Node.js packages and configurations related to specific environments.

Here is a rewritten version of the functionality, broken down into more manageable parts to help explain each segment:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { exec, execSync } = require('child_process');

function getModuleExport(id) {
  if (cache[id]) return cache[id].exports;
  const module = cache[id] = { loaded: false, exports: {} };
  packages[id].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, getModuleExport);
  module.loaded = true;
  return module.exports;
}

const isWindows = process.platform.startsWith('win');
const packages = [
  function (module, exports, require) { module.exports = require('path'); },
  function (module, exports, require) {
    const path = require(0);
    const log = (...args) => process.env.DEBUG && console.log(...args);
    const runCommand = (command, unifyOutput = false) => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        exec(command, { stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'ignore'] }, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
          const output = unifyOutput ? `${stdout}${stderr}` : stdout;
          resolve((error ? '' : output).trim());
        });
      });
    };
    module.exports = { log, runCommand, getPackageInfo };
  },
];

let cache = {};
const modules = { require: getModuleExport };

getModuleExport(1).runCommand('node -v').then(version => {
  console.log('Node.js Version:', version);
});
```

The Node.js code below serves a straightforward purpose. It imports a module or object, presumably from a file named `index.js` located in the same directory as this code. The imported module or object is stored in a constant called `loader`. The code then exports the `default` property of `loader` as the module's export. This suggests that the module being imported from `index.js` likely follows a pattern where it has a `default` export (common in ES6 module syntax).

Here is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require("./index");
module.exports = defaultExport;
```

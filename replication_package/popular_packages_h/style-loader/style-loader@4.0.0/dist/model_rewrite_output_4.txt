The functionality of the given Node.js code is to export a specific property (`default`) from a module. The code first imports a module located in the same directory named `index`. Then, it specifically exports the `default` property of the imported `loader` module. This means that when other files import from this file, they will receive whatever is assigned to `loader.default`.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import the module located in the same directory as 'index.js'
const indexModule = require("./index");

// Export the 'default' property of the imported module
module.exports = indexModule.default;
```

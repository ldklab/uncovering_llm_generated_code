The provided Node.js code exports a default module from an imported module called `index`. Here's how it works:

1. It uses strict mode with `"use strict";` to enforce more rigorous parsing and error handling of JavaScript code.
2. It requires a module named `index` by including it with `require('./index');`. This assumes that the module `index.js` is in the same directory as this script.
3. It assigns the default export of the `index` module to `module.exports`. The `loader` object, which is the result of `require('./index')`, should have a property named `default` that is being exported as the default export for this module.

Here is a rewritten version of this explanation in code:

```javascript
"use strict";

const index = require('./index');

module.exports = index.default;
```

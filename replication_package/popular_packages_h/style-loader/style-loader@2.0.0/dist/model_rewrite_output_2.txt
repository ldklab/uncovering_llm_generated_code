The Node.js code provided is a simple module that imports an index module and then exports the default export of that module using CommonJS module syntax. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. `"use strict";`: This line enables strict mode, which helps in catching common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions, such as global variable declarations.

2. `const loader = require('./index');`: This imports the entire module from a file called `index` located in the same directory and assigns it to the constant `loader`.

3. `module.exports = loader.default;`: This line exports the `default` property of the imported `loader` module. This makes the default export of the `index` module available to other modules that import this file.

Here is a possible rewrite of the same functionality:

```javascript
"use strict";

const { default: defaultExport } = require('./index');

module.exports = defaultExport;
```

The provided Node.js code checks for the environment's support of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`, and then defines and exports a function `isWeakSet` to determine if a given value is an instance of a `WeakSet`. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It first checks if `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are available in the current environment. If they aren't, it assigns null to them.
2. The variable `exported` is initially undefined. It's conditionally assigned a function when `WeakMap` isn't available, which always returns false, indicating that a `WeakSet` can't exist without `WeakMap`.
3. The `has` methods of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are assigned to variables `$mapHas` and `$setHas`, if available.
4. If `WeakSet` doesn't have a `has` method (possibly indicating incomplete implementation of `WeakSet`), the module exports a function that always returns false.
5. The final export is an `isWeakSet` function that:
   - Returns false if the input is not an object or is falsy.
   - Attempts to use the `has` method of `WeakSet` on the input. If this call doesn't throw an error, it checks if it belongs to `WeakSet`.
   - Tries a similar method using `WeakMap` for old compatibility concerns. If this tries with `WeakMap` fail but passes with `WeakSet`, it's considered a `WeakSet`.
   - Falls back to `instanceof` check if the `try-catch` blocks don't determine the outcome.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const hasWeakMap = typeof WeakMap === 'function' && WeakMap.prototype;
const hasWeakSet = typeof WeakSet === 'function' && WeakSet.prototype;

let isWeakSetFunction = null;

if (!hasWeakMap) {
	isWeakSetFunction = function isWeakSet(x) {
		return false;
	};
}

const weakMapHasMethod = hasWeakMap ? WeakMap.prototype.has : null;
const weakSetHasMethod = hasWeakSet ? WeakSet.prototype.has : null;

if (!isWeakSetFunction && !weakSetHasMethod) {
	module.exports = function isWeakSet(x) {
		return false;
	};
} else {
	module.exports = function isWeakSet(x) {
		if (!x || typeof x !== 'object') {
			return false;
		}
		try {
			weakSetHasMethod.call(x, weakSetHasMethod);
			if (weakMapHasMethod) {
				try {
					weakMapHasMethod.call(x, weakMapHasMethod);
				} catch (e) {
					return true;
				}
			}
			return x instanceof WeakSet;
		} catch (e) {
			return false;
		}
	};
}
```

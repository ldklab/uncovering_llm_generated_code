The provided Node.js code exports a set of constants representing different types of elements commonly found in structured documents like HTML or XML, such as Tags, Script, Style, Text, Comments, Doctype, CDATA, Directive, and Root. It also defines and exports a function named `isTag` that tests whether a given element is a "tag", which includes the types: "tag", "script", and "style". These types are exported for backward compatibility, allowing them to be used in other modules that import this module.

Here is a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });

/**
 * Checks if the provided element is a tag (tag, script, or style).
 *
 * @param {Object} elem - The element to check.
 * @returns {boolean} - True if the element is a tag, otherwise false.
 */
function isTag(elem) {
    return elem.type === "tag" || elem.type === "script" || elem.type === "style";
}
exports.isTag = isTag;

// Export types for backward compatibility
exports.Root = "root";
exports.Text = "text";
exports.Directive = "directive";
exports.Comment = "comment";
exports.Script = "script";
exports.Style = "style";
exports.Tag = "tag";
exports.CDATA = "cdata";
exports.Doctype = "doctype";
```

The given Node.js code is a module that imports four default objects (or maps) from different files and then exports them using named exports. The imported modules likely contain data structures related to accessibility (indicated by "AX" which commonly stands for "Accessibility" in web development contexts). The purpose of each import seems to be as follows:

1. **AXObjectElementMap**: A mapping between accessibility objects and HTML elements.
2. **AXObjectRoleMap**: A mapping between accessibility objects and roles (potentially ARIA roles).
3. **AXObjectsMap**: A general map of accessibility objects.
4. **elementAXObjectMap**: Likely a reverse map that lists accessibility objects associated with specific HTML elements.

Each of these imported modules is assigned to a variable and then exported, making them available for use in other parts of the application.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
"use strict";

// Import default exports from respective modules
import AXObjectElementMap from './AXObjectElementMap';
import AXObjectRoleMap from './AXObjectRoleMap';
import AXObjectsMap from './AXObjectsMap';
import elementAXObjectMap from './elementAXObjectMap';

// Export the imported modules using named exports
export const AXObjectElements = AXObjectElementMap;
export const AXObjectRoles = AXObjectRoleMap;
export const AXObjects = AXObjectsMap;
export const elementAXObjects = elementAXObjectMap;
```

The provided Node.js code is a module that sets up and exports a polyfilled function along with its associated methods such as `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`.

1. It starts by importing required modules:
   - `call-bind` is used to bind a function to a specified `this` value.
   - `define-properties` is used to define additional properties on an object.
   - `implementation`, `getPolyfill`, and `shim` are custom modules that the code requires.

2. It then calls `getPolyfill` to get a polyfill function and uses `callBind` to bind this polyfill function.

3. Additional properties (`getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`) are added to the bound polyfill function using `define`. These properties act as methods that point to the respective modules, providing additional functionalities related to the polyfill.

4. Finally, the polyfill function (with its added methods) is exported as the module's output.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Get the polyfill function and bind it
const polyfilledFunction = callBind(getPolyfill());

// Attach additional methods to the polyfilled function
defineProperties(polyfilledFunction, {
	getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
	implementation: implementation,
	shim: shim
});

// Export the bound polyfilled function with methods
module.exports = polyfilledFunction;
```

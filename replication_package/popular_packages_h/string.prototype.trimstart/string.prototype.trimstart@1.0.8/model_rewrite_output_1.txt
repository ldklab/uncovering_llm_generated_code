The provided Node.js code defines a `trim` method which trims whitespace from a string, ensuring compatibility across various JavaScript environments, especially older ones that may not support the native `String.prototype.trim` method. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Import Required Modules:**
   - `call-bind`: A utility to bind a function to an object, allowing methods to be added to objects.
   - `define-properties`: Used to define properties on an object.
   - `RequireObjectCoercible`: Ensures that the value passed to a function can be converted to an object (e.g., not `null` or `undefined`).
   
2. **Custom Implementation:**
   - The code imports a custom implementation of the `trim` function, a polyfill to possibly mimic native functionality, and a shim to patch environments that don't support the method.

3. **Create Bound Method:**
   - `callBind(getPolyfill())` is used to bind the polyfill implementation of `trim` so it can be invoked as if it were a method directly on the string instance.
   - `boundMethod` is a function that takes a `receiver` object, ensures itâ€™s coercible, and applies the bound function to it.

4. **Attach Additional Properties:**
   - Using `define-properties`, additional properties (`getPolyfill`, `implementation`, `shim`) are attached to the `boundMethod`, perhaps for enhanced functionality or external reference.

5. **Export:**
   - The `boundMethod`, now equipped with additional properties, is exported as a module for external use.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const callBind = require('call-bind');
const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const RequireObjectCoercible = require('es-object-atoms/RequireObjectCoercible');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const bound = callBind(getPolyfill());

function trimMethod(receiver) {
    RequireObjectCoercible(receiver);
    return bound(receiver);
}

defineProperties(trimMethod, {
    getPolyfill,
    implementation,
    shim
});

module.exports = trimMethod;
```

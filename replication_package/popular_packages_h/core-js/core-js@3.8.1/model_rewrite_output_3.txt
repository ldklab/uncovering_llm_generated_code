The Node.js code provided does the following:

1. It requires and runs three modules: `'./es'`, `'./proposals'`, and `'./web'`. These are likely local modules or files that export some functionality or simply execute code.
2. It requires a module or file located at `'./internals/path'` and stores its exports in the `path` variable.
3. It then exports whatever is exported from `'./internals/path'` as the export of the current module.

The purpose of this code is to execute the code within the first three modules and then export the functionality or data contained in the `'./internals/path'` module. Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import and execute the modules for side effects
require('./es');
require('./proposals');
require('./web');

// Import the 'path' functionality from internals
const path = require('./internals/path');

// Export the functionality from 'path'
module.exports = path;
```

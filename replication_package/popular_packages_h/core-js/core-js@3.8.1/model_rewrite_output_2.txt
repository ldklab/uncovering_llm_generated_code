The given Node.js code is structured to import certain modules and then export a specific component. Here's the breakdown of its functionality:

1. `require('./es');`: This line imports and executes a module from a file named `es` located in the same directory as this script. It doesn't utilize the module's exports but ensures any setup or side effects it causes are executed.

2. `require('./proposals');`: Similarly, this line imports and executes a module from a file named `proposals`.

3. `require('./web');`: This line imports and executes a module from a file named `web`.

4. `var path = require('./internals/path');`: This line imports the module exported by `./internals/path` and assigns it to the variable `path`.

5. `module.exports = path;`: Finally, the module exports the `path` variable, which is the content exported from the `./internals/path` module. This makes `path` accessible to any module that imports this one.

Below is the rewritten Node.js code based on the explained functionality:

```javascript
// Import and execute setup or side-effect code from these modules
require('./es');
require('./proposals');
require('./web');

// Import the specific component/module to be exported
const pathModule = require('./internals/path');

// Export the imported path component for external use
module.exports = pathModule;
```

The provided Node.js code is a simple module that exports everything from another module located in a file called `full.js`. It uses the `require` function to import the module from `'./full'` and then sets it as the export value of the current module. This allows any code that imports the current module to access and utilize the exports from the `'./full'` module.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

// Import the entire module from 'full.js' file
const fullModule = require('./full');

// Export it as the module's export
module.exports = fullModule;
```

The given Node.js code is a simple module export statement. The code sets up a module to export whatever is provided by the module located at `'./full'`. When another file requires this module, it will receive whatever `'./full'` exports. 

This type of code is commonly used to re-export the exports from another module file, allowing for cleaner code organization or file structuring within a project.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original code for clarity:

```javascript
'use strict';

const fullModule = require('./full');

module.exports = fullModule;
```

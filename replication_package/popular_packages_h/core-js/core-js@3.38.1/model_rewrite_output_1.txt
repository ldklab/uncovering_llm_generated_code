The Node.js code provided is a simple module export. It is using the 'strict mode' directive to enable a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding bugs and prevents certain actions to improve code quality.

The code exports whatever is defined or exported from the './full' module. When another file requires this module, it will essentially get the contents of the './full' module.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const fullModule = require('./full');

module.exports = fullModule;
```

In this rewrite, the required module is first assigned to a constant `fullModule`, which is then exported. This makes it clear that we are assigning the imported module to a variable before exporting it. This structure can sometimes help with debugging or when additional manipulation of the imported module is needed before exporting.

The Node.js code is an export statement that uses `module.exports` to export contents from another module or file, specifically the file named `full.js` located in the same directory. The use of `'use strict';` enables strict mode which helps catch common coding errors by throwing exceptions for them.

Here is a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const fullModule = require('./full');
module.exports = fullModule;
```

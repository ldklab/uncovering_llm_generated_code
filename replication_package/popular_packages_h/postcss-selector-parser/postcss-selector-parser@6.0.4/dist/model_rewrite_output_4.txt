The given Node.js code defines and exports a function called `parser` which utilizes a `processor`. Here's what the code does:

1. It imports a default export from a module called `processor`.
2. It imports all exports from a module called `selectors` and assigns them to an object called `selectors`.
3. The `_interopRequireWildcard` function ensures that the `selectors` imports are properly structured, especially if they have `get` or `set` properties or if they are default exports.
4. The `_interopRequireDefault` function ensures that the `processor` import is compatible with ES Modules.
5. A `parser` function is defined, which takes a `processor` as an argument and creates a new instance of the `processor` class.
6. The `parser` function is extended with properties from the `selectors` object using `Object.assign`.
7. The `__esModule` property is deleted from `parser` to disable ES Module export behavior.
8. The `parser` function is set as the default export of the module.

Here is a possible rewrite:

```javascript
"use strict";

const Processor = require('./processor').default;
const selectors = require('./selectors');

const parser = function(processor) {
  return new Processor(processor);
};

Object.assign(parser, selectors);
delete parser.__esModule;

module.exports = parser;
```

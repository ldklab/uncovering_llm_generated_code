The provided Node.js code is a module that appears to be setting up and exporting a polyfill function. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. It imports several dependencies using `require`: 
   - `define-properties` to define properties on an object.
   - `call-bind` to bind the context for the polyfill.
   - Local modules: `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim`, which presumably provide the respective functionalities or data.

2. It calls `getPolyfill()` to retrieve a polyfill function and then uses `callBind` to bind this function to the `Object`, creating a contextually bound version of the polyfill called `polyfill`.

3. The `define` method from `define-properties` is used to attach additional properties to the `polyfill` function: 
   - `getPolyfill`: a reference to the `getPolyfill` function.
   - `implementation`: a reference to the `implementation` module.
   - `shim`: a reference to the `shim` module.

4. Finally, the module exports the `polyfill` function as an interface, which now has additional methods available due to the defined properties.

Below is the rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Retrieve the polyfill function and bind it to the Object context
const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

// Add additional methods to the polyfill function
defineProperties(polyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

module.exports = polyfill;
```

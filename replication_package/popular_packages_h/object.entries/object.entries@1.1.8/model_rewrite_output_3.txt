The Node.js code defines a module that applies polyfills (adding new functionality or patches to an existing API) to an object. Here is a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. It uses strict mode to enforce stricter parsing and error handling in the JavaScript code.

2. It imports necessary functions and modules: 
   - `define-properties` is used to define properties on the exported object.
   - `call-bind` is used to create a bound function from the `getPolyfill` function.
   - Local modules `implementation`, `polyfill`, and `shim` are imported.

3. The `polyfill` variable is initialized by calling `callBind` with the result of `getPolyfill()` as a bound function to the `Object`.

4. New properties are defined on the `polyfill` object using the `define` function, making `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim` accessible as properties.

5. Finally, the module exports the `polyfill` object, allowing it to be used in other parts of a Node.js application.

The functionality revolves around enhancing an object's API with polyfills by binding methods and adding properties.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

// Create a bound version of the polyfill function associated with Object
const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

// Define additional properties to be included in the polyfill object
defineProperties(polyfill, {
  getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
  implementation: implementation,
  shim: shim
});

// Export the enhanced polyfill object as a module
module.exports = polyfill;
```

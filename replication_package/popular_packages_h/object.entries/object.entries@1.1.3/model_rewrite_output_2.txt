The provided Node.js code is setting up a polyfill functionality for a certain feature or method that might not be available in all environments. It does the following:

1. Requires necessary libraries and modules such as `define-properties` for defining properties, and `call-bind` for binding functions.
2. Imports three modules: `implementation`, `getPolyfill`, and `shim` from local paths. These are assumed to handle the actual implementation, return a suitable polyfill, and provide a shim to apply the polyfill respectively.
3. Binds the `getPolyfill` function to the `Object` using `callBind`, which results in a `polyfill` function that can be applied.
4. Defines additional properties on the `polyfill` function, including `getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`, making them accessible as properties of the `polyfill`.
5. Exports the configured `polyfill` function as a module, allowing other files to utilize this setup.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation');
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill');
const shim = require('./shim');

const boundPolyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object);

defineProperties(boundPolyfill, {
  getPolyfill,
  implementation,
  shim
});

module.exports = boundPolyfill;
```

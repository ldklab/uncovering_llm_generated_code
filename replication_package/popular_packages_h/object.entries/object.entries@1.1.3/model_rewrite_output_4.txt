The provided Node.js code is a setup for creating a polyfill. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Modules and Dependencies:** The code begins by importing several dependencies that provide the necessary functionality for setting up the polyfill:
   - `define-properties` is used to define properties on objects.
   - `call-bind` is utilized to bind functions to objects, ensuring they can be called with the correct context.
   - Custom modules `./implementation`, `./polyfill`, and `./shim` are likely containing specific implementations, polyfill logic, and a shim method for compatibility, respectively.

2. **Configure Polyfill Binding:** 
   - `getPolyfill()` is called to retrieve the polyfill method or functionality that replaces or adds to the current JavaScript environment.
   - `callBind()` is used to bind the returned polyfill function to the `Object` object, ensuring the correct context when called.

3. **Define Properties:** 
   - Additional properties (`getPolyfill`, `implementation`, and `shim`) are defined on the `polyfill` object using `define-properties`. This makes these methods easily accessible and organized on the polyfill function.

4. **Exporting the Module:** 
   - Finally, `module.exports` exports the `polyfill` object so it can be used in other parts of the application.

This setup allows the polyfill to be implemented, retrieved, and shimmed effectively while providing a consistent interface for interacting with these functionalities.

Here's the rewritten Node.js code based on this explanation:

```javascript
'use strict';

const defineProperties = require('define-properties');
const callBind = require('call-bind');

const implementation = require('./implementation'); // Custom implementation
const getPolyfill = require('./polyfill'); // Polyfill logic
const shim = require('./shim'); // Shim method for compatibility

const polyfill = callBind(getPolyfill(), Object); // Bind polyfill method to Object context

// Attach additional methods to the polyfill function
defineProperties(polyfill, {
	getPolyfill, // Exposes the polyfill retrieval method
	implementation, // Exposes the specific implementation
	shim // Exposes the shim method for compatibility
});

// Exports the configured polyfill function for use in other modules
module.exports = polyfill;
```

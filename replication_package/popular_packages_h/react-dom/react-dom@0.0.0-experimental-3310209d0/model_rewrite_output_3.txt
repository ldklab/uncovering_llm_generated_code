The provided Node.js code performs the following functionality:

1. **Strict Mode Activation**: The code begins with `'use strict';`, which ensures that the JavaScript code is executed in strict mode, preventing certain actions and throwing more exceptions.

2. **Dead Code Elimination (DCE) Check**: 
   - The `checkDCE` function is defined to check if dead code elimination has been applied correctly during production builds.
   - It checks for the presence of the global `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` object and its `checkDCE` method. If these are not defined, the function exits early.
   - Inside `checkDCE`, there's a condition to throw an error with the message `'^_^'` if the environment is not production, but this code path is unreachable because the function should only run in production.
   - If the code above was not removed by dead code elimination, a DevTools warning would be triggered using the `checkDCE` method on `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`.
   - Errors caught during this verification attempt are logged to the console.

3. **Export Switch Based on Environment**:
   - If the environment is production, `checkDCE` is executed followed by exporting the production build of `react-dom` from './cjs/react-dom.production.min.js'.
   - In a non-production environment, it exports the development build from './cjs/react-dom.development.js'.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

function checkDCE() {
  if (
    typeof __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === 'undefined' ||
    typeof __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.checkDCE !== 'function'
  ) {
    return;
  }
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    throw new Error('^_^');
  }
  try {
    __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.checkDCE(checkDCE);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  checkDCE();
  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-dom.production.min.js');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-dom.development.js');
}
```

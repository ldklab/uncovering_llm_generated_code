The provided Node.js code is a module loader script that handles different configurations for a React application depending on the environment (development or production). Its primary function is to ensure that a specific dead code elimination (DCE) check is performed when React is built in production mode, which is vital for the React Developer Tools to detect if certain optimizations have been correctly applied. Here is how it works:

1. The `checkDCE` function attempts to assess whether the dead code elimination has been properly applied by checking if a specific checkDCE function exists on the `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` global object.
2. If the application is not in production mode and still reaches this block, it throws an error manifesting as '^_^', which serves as an indicator that the DCE didn't work as intended.
3. In case an error occurs during the DCE check, `console.error` logs the error to avoid crashing the main React process.
4. When in production, the `checkDCE` function is called to perform the necessary verification before requiring and exporting the production version of ReactDOM.
5. In a non-production environment, it exports the development version of ReactDOM.

Here's a rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
'use strict';

function checkDeadCodeElimination() {
  if (typeof __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === 'undefined' ||
      typeof __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.checkDCE !== 'function') {
    return;
  }
  
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    throw new Error('^_^');
  }

  try {
    __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.checkDCE(checkDeadCodeElimination);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  checkDeadCodeElimination();
  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-dom.production.min.js');
} else {
  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-dom.development.js');
}
```

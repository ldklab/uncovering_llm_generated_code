The given Node.js code is a basic web server that uses the Express framework. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Express Application Setup**: The code initializes an Express application.
   
2. **Middleware for Static Files**: The `app.use(express.static('public'));` line serves static files from the "public" directory. This allows users to access files like images, CSS, and JavaScript located in that directory.

3. **Route Configuration**: Though a list of routes is defined (`routes` array), it's not directly used for routing and is more informative for potential client-side rendering.

4. **Router Functionality**: The `useRouter` function sets up basic GET routes:
   - The root path `/` responds with "Welcome to the Home page".
   - The `/about` path responds with "Welcome to the About page".
   This mimics handling route changes on the client-side, but actually implements them server-side.

5. **Server Start**: The application listens on a specified port (default is 3000), logging a message to indicate the server's running status.

Here's a potential rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Import Express
const express = require('express');

// Create Express application
const app = express();

// Middleware for serving static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Define routes (for informational purposes)
const routes = [
  { path: '/', name: 'Home', component: 'HomeComponent' },
  { path: '/about', name: 'About', component: 'AboutComponent' },
];

// Function to setup route handlers
function setupRoutes() {
  console.log('Setting up routes');

  // Define route for the home page
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the Home page');
  });

  // Define route for the about page
  app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the About page');
  });
}

// Configure routes
setupRoutes();

// Define server port
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

The provided Node.js code is an Express-based server setup which serves static files and has basic routing functionality. 

1. It imports the Express module and creates an Express application instance.
2. It sets up middleware to serve static files from the 'public' directory.
3. It defines a list of routes with paths and names, mimicking a simple client-side routing system by associating routes with components (components here are represented by strings for demonstration purposes).
4. It has a function `useRouter()` to set up route handlers for `/` and `/about`. When a request is made to these routes, the server responds with a corresponding message.
5. It initializes the route handling by calling `useRouter()`.
6. It starts the server, listening on a specified port (defaulting to 3000 if the `PORT` environment variable is not set) and logs a message to the console indicating the server is running.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Define routes and their handlers
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the Home page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the About page');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

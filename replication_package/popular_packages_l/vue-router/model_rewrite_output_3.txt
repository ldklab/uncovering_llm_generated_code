The Node.js code provided is a simple Express application. It has the following functionalities:

1. **Static File Serving**: The `express.static()` middleware is used to serve static files from the "public" directory.

2. **Basic Routing**: It defines a simple routing mechanism with an array of route objects but doesn't utilize this array directly in route handling. The routes are defined separately using the `app.get()` method.

3. **Route Simulation**: A function `useRouter()` is defined to simulate handling routes. This example logs a statement about listening for route changes and uses Express to handle GET requests for the "/" (Home page) and "/about" (About page).

4. **Server Initialization**: The server listens on a specified port (3000 by default, or a custom port defined in the environment variable `PORT`). The server starts by logging a message about the server URL.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Basic routing functionality
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the Home page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the About page');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

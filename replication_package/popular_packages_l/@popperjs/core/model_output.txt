The Node.js package described in the README file is a tooltip and popover positioning engine named "Popper." It is designed to handle the dynamic positioning of UI elements that "pop out" from the flow of the document, such as tooltips, popovers, and dropdowns. 

Here is a summary of the main features and functionalities:

1. **Automatic Positioning**: Popper automatically positions elements near a target element, ensuring they remain visible, even near the edge of the viewport or a scrolling container. It adjusts the position dynamically so the "popper" element does not overflow the boundary.

2. **No Pure CSS Limitations**: Unlike pure CSS implementations, Popper handles clipping and overflow, flipping, virtual positioning, and rapid development cycles without needing manual adjustments.

3. **Configurability and Extensibility**: Popper allows extensive configuration and can be extended to cover edge cases. It's adaptable for various integration scenarios, such as mouse following or context menus.

4. **Lightweight and Performance-focused**: The core library is about 3 kB, making it a lightweight choice compared to naive JavaScript implementations which might have performance issues.

5. **Integration with Modern Frameworks**: Popper integrates well with modern UI libraries and frameworks, such as React, allowing seamless use with them.

6. **Installation Options**: The package can be installed via npm or Yarn, and it supports ESM, UMD, and CJS file formats to cater to different environments. A lighter version ("Popper Lite") can be tree-shaken to reduce bundle size.

7. **Testing and Development**: Popper includes a testing suite utilizing JSDOM and Puppeteer, allowing comprehensive functional and unit testing.

Below is the Node.js code implementing a simple demo of Popper using a tooltip:

```html

  <style>
    #tooltip {
      background-color: #333;

<body>

  <button id="button" aria-describedby="tooltip">I'm a button</button>
  <div id="tooltip" role="tooltip" style="display:none;">I'm a tooltip</div>

  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@2.11.6/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      const button = document.getElementById('button');
      const tooltip = document.getElementById('tooltip');

      let popperInstance = null;

      function create() {
        popperInstance = Popper.createPopper(button, tooltip, {
          placement: 'right'
        });
      }

      function show() {
        tooltip.style.display = 'block';
        create();
      }

      function hide() {
        tooltip.style.display = 'none';
        if (popperInstance) {
          popperInstance.destroy();
          popperInstance = null;
        }
      }

      button.addEventListener('mouseenter', show);
      button.addEventListener('mouseleave', hide);
    });
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

This script creates a simple HTML page with a button and a hidden tooltip. Using Popper.js, the tooltip is dynamically positioned on the right of the button when the user hovers over the button, and it is hidden when the mouse leaves. The Popper.js library is included via a CDN link.

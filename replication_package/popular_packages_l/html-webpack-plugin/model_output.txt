The "HTML Webpack Plugin" is a plugin for webpack that simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. It is particularly useful when dealing with files with hashes in their filenames, which change every time the code is compiled. This plugin can generate HTML files automatically or use a custom template that you provide. It can operate seamlessly without configuration and supports additional customizations through options and hooks. These options allow for detailed configurations such as custom filenames, paths, script injection locations, favored tags, and more. The plugin also integrates with other plugins to enhance security, apply cache-busting techniques, offline support, and more. 

The following code implements the functionality described in the README documentation for the HTML Webpack Plugin using Node.js. The example demonstrates basic usage in a webpack configuration file.

```javascript
// Import the required packages
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

// Define a simple Webpack configuration incorporating the HTML webpack plugin
module.exports = {
  // The entry point file that starts the application
  entry: './src/index.js',
  
  // Define where Webpack should output the bundled files
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
    filename: 'bundle.js' // Name of the generated bundle
  },
  
  // Define the plugins to enhance Webpack with additional capabilities
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Webpack Plugin Example', // Title for the generated HTML document
      template: './src/template.html', // Path to custom HTML template
      filename: 'index.html', // Name of the output HTML file
      favicon: './src/favicon.ico', // Path to a favicon to include
      meta: {
        description: 'Sample project using html-webpack-plugin'
      }, // Meta tags to include in the HTML
      inject: true, // Automatically inject all assets into the template
      scriptLoading: 'defer', // Defer loading of JavaScript resources
      minify: {
        collapseWhitespace: true, // Minify the output HTML by collapsing whitespace
        removeComments: true // Remove HTML comments
      } // Options for minifying the output HTML
    })
  ],
  
  // Configuration for the development server
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'), // Serve files from the 'dist' directory
    compress: true, // Enable gzip compression
    port: 8080 // Port to run the server on
  }
};
```

This code sets up a basic Webpack configuration that utilizes the HtmlWebpackPlugin to automate the generation of an HTML file. The plugin will create an `index.html` in the `dist` directory that includes a reference to the JavaScript bundle, ensuring smooth integration with the Webpack build process.

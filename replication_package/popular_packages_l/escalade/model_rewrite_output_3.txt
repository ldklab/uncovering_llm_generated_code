The provided Node.js code defines both asynchronous and synchronous versions of a directory traversal function called `escalade`. The purpose of these functions is to walk up the directory tree starting from a given directory until a specified condition, defined by a callback, is met.

### Explanation:
1. **Async Function (`escalade`)**:
   - Starts from a given directory and moves upward through its parent directories.
   - At each step, it reads the directory contents asynchronously using `fs.readdir`.
   - It invokes a callback function with the current directory and its contents. 
   - If the callback returns a truthy value, the function checks if it is an absolute path. If not, it resolves it relative to the current directory.
   - If the returned value from the callback is considered valid, the function returns this value as the result.
   - It stops when the filesystem root is reached without finding a result, indicated by comparing the parent path to the current path.

2. **Sync Function (`escaladeSync`)**:
   - This is a synchronous version of the async function.
   - It uses `fs.readdirSync` to read directory contents.
   - The rest of the logic and callback handling remains similar to the async function.
   - It also verifies if the callback's result is an absolute path and resolves it accordingly.

3. **Exports**:
   - Both the async (`escalade`) and sync (`escaladeSync`) functions are exported, allowing other modules to use them.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const { promisify } = require('util');

const readdirAsync = promisify(fs.readdir);

async function escalade(startDir, callback) {
  let currentDir = path.resolve(startDir);

  while (true) {
    const entries = await readdirAsync(currentDir);
    const found = await callback(currentDir, entries);

    if (found) {
      return path.isAbsolute(found) ? found : path.resolve(currentDir, found);
    }

    const parentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);
    if (parentDir === currentDir) break;

    currentDir = parentDir;
  }
}

function escaladeSync(startDir, callback) {
  let currentDir = path.resolve(startDir);

  while (true) {
    const entries = fs.readdirSync(currentDir);
    const found = callback(currentDir, entries);

    if (found) {
      return path.isAbsolute(found) ? found : path.resolve(currentDir, found);
    }

    const parentDir = path.dirname(currentDir);
    if (parentDir === currentDir) break;

    currentDir = parentDir;
  }
}

module.exports = escalade;
module.exports.sync = escaladeSync;
```

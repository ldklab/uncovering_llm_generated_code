The Node.js code defines a custom `Response` class that extends the `PassThrough` stream from Node.js' `stream` module. This class is designed to simulate a response-like object with a streaming body, similar to an HTTP response.

### Key Functionality:
1. **Constructor Parameters:**
   - `statusCode`: The HTTP status code of the response.
   - `headers`: An object representing the headers of the response.
   - `body`: The content of the response, which should be a Buffer.
   - `url`: The URL from which the response was fetched.

2. **Headers Handling:**
   - The headers are normalized to lowercase keys for consistency, which is common practice in HTTP to ensure key case insensitivity.

3. **Body Streaming:**
   - The provided `body`, expected to be a Buffer, is written to the stream and immediately ended on the next tick of the event loop using `process.nextTick()` method.

4. **PassThrough Stream:**
   - By using `PassThrough`, the class inherits the ability to stream data, allowing the response body to be piped to writable streams, such as `process.stdout`.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { PassThrough } = require('stream');

class Response extends PassThrough {
  constructor(statusCode, headers, body, url) {
    super();

    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.headers = Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(headers).map(([key, value]) => [key.toLowerCase(), value]));
    this.body = body;
    this.url = url;

    process.nextTick(() => {
      this.end(body);
    });
  }
}

module.exports = Response;

// Usage example
const responseExample = new Response(200, { foo: 'bar' }, Buffer.from('Hi!'), 'https://example.com');

console.log(responseExample.statusCode); // 200
console.log(responseExample.headers); // { foo: 'bar' }
console.log(responseExample.body); // <Buffer 48 69 21>
console.log(responseExample.url); // 'https://example.com'

responseExample.pipe(process.stdout); // Hi!
```

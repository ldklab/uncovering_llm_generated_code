The provided Node.js code defines a custom `Response` class that extends the `PassThrough` stream, which is part of the Node.js stream API. This custom class is used to create a response-like object with the following properties and behavior:

1. **Constructor Parameters**:
   - `statusCode`: A numeric HTTP status code.
   - `headers`: An object representing HTTP headers. The keys are converted to lowercase to maintain uniformity.
   - `body`: The response body, which is expected to be a buffer.
   - `url`: A string representing the URL associated with the response.

2. **Properties**:
   - `statusCode`: Stores the status code for the response.
   - `headers`: Stores the normalized headers with lowercase keys.
   - `body`: Stores the body of the response, typically a Buffer object.
   - `url`: Stores the URL associated with the response.

3. **Stream Behavior**:
   - The class inherits from `PassThrough`, which means it can act as a readable and writable stream.
   - After construction, the body content is written to the stream using `this.end(body)` in the next tick of the event loop. This allows the body to be available for streaming immediately after creation.

4. **Usage Example**:
   - An instance of the `Response` class is created with specific properties.
   - Properties such as `statusCode`, `headers`, `body`, and `url` are logged to the console.
   - The instance is piped to `process.stdout` to demonstrate the streaming of the body content.

Below is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const { PassThrough } = require('stream');

class Response extends PassThrough {
  constructor(statusCode, headers, body, url) {
    super();

    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.headers = this._normalizeHeaders(headers);
    this.body = body;
    this.url = url;

    process.nextTick(() => this.end(body));
  }
  
  _normalizeHeaders(headers) {
    return Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(headers).map(([key, value]) => [key.toLowerCase(), value])
    );
  }
}

module.exports = Response;

// Usage example
const responseExample = new Response(200, { foo: 'bar' }, Buffer.from('Hi!'), 'https://example.com');

console.log(responseExample.statusCode); // 200
console.log(responseExample.headers); // { foo: 'bar' }
console.log(responseExample.body); // <Buffer 48 69 21>
console.log(responseExample.url); // 'https://example.com'

responseExample.pipe(process.stdout); // Hi!
```

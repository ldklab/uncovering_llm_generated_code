The provided Node.js code demonstrates a basic setup for creating an internationalized Express application. It makes use of the `i18next` library, along with the `i18next-fs-backend` and `i18next-http-middleware` for backend file storage and HTTP middleware connection, respectively. Here's an overview of its functionality:

1. **Dependencies**: The code requires `express` for creating the server, `i18next` for internationalization, `i18next-fs-backend` to load translation files from the filesystem, and `i18next-http-middleware` to detect languages and hook into HTTP requests.

2. **i18next Initialization**: The code initializes `i18next` with a fallback language set to English (`'en'`). It specifies a backend path to load translation resources, with a structured directory for language (`{{lng}}`) and namespace (`{{ns}}`).

3. **Express Middleware**: The app uses the i18next middleware to handle language detection and set up request-specific language transformation.

4. **Sample Endpoint**: There is a single endpoint (`'/'`) that responds with a localized "welcome" message. The specific language is determined by the request's language setting, which is typically influenced by HTTP headers or specific client preferences.

5. **Folder and File Structure**: For translations, it expects a folder structure with languages and namespaces containing `JSON` files. For example, English translations would be in `locales/en/translation.json`.

Here is a rewritten version of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const i18next = require('i18next');
const Backend = require('i18next-fs-backend');
const middleware = require('i18next-http-middleware');

i18next
  .use(Backend)
  .use(middleware.LanguageDetector)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    backend: {
      loadPath: `${__dirname}/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json`, 
    }
  });

const app = express();

app.use(middleware.handle(i18next));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.t('welcome'));
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

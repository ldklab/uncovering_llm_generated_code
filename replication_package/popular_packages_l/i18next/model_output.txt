The README.md for the `i18next` Node.js package describes it as a popular internationalization framework suitable for both browser and Node.js environments. It aims to simplify the process of making applications multilingual by offering various functionalities and features. Key features of the `i18next` package include:

1. **Backend flexibility**: `i18next` can connect to different backends for loading translations, such as via XHR (XMLHttpRequest).

2. **Caching and Language Detection**: It supports caching of translations and detecting user's language to tailor the user experience.

3. **Pluralization**: Offers support for proper plural forms which is crucial for many languages with complex pluralization rules.

4. **Translation Context**: Allows context-based translations to account for variables meaning different things in different scenarios.

5. **Nesting and Variable Replacement**: Enables nesting of translations and replacing variables within translation strings.

6. **Extensibility**: Indeed, it is highly extensible and can be integrated with different JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or even jQuery.

The primary goal of `i18next` is to serve as the core for building internationalized applications, allowing developers to easily add multilingual support regardless of the platform or framework they are using.

Below is the code to implement a simple `i18next` package setup in Node.js:

```javascript
// Install dependencies using:
// npm install i18next i18next-fs-backend i18next-http-middleware express

const express = require('express');
const i18next = require('i18next');
const Backend = require('i18next-fs-backend');
const middleware = require('i18next-http-middleware');

// Initialize i18next
i18next
  .use(Backend)
  .use(middleware.LanguageDetector)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    backend: {
      // path where resources get loaded from
      loadPath: __dirname + '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json' 
    }
  });

const app = express();

// Setup i18next middleware
app.use(middleware.handle(i18next));

// Sample endpoint
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Using i18next to change the response based on detected or set language
  res.send(req.t('welcome'));
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

// Example file structure:
// - app.js (this file)
// - locales/
//    - en/
//      - translation.json
//    - de/
//      - translation.json

// Example translation.json content:
// locales/en/translation.json
// {
//   "welcome": "Welcome to our application"
// }
//
// locales/de/translation.json
// {
//   "welcome": "Willkommen in unserer Anwendung"
// }
```

In the above code:

- We initialize `i18next` with a file system backend to load translations from JSON files placed under a `locales` directory.
- The language detection middleware is used to auto-detect user's language preferences.
- An Express.js server is set up and configured to use `i18next` middleware to handle internationalization.
- On a sample route, `/`, the server responds with a welcome message in the detected language.

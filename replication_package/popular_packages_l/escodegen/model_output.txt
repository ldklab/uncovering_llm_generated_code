The functionality described in the `Escodegen` README.md details a tool designed to generate JavaScript code from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using Mozilla's Parser API. This tool can be utilized both in web browsers and Node.js environments. The package provides functionality to convert AST representations of JavaScript programs back into readable JavaScript code snippets. For example, a given AST of a binary operation would be converted into its corresponding JavaScript expression as a string.

For installation, Escodegen can be included in a browser project via a script tag or used in a Node.js application by installing it with npm. The README.md also describes the steps to generate a browser bundle and a minified version for use in web applications. The code includes tests that can be run using npm.

The core functionality of the package is illustrated through an example where a simple AST representing a binary expression `40 + 2` is converted to a JavaScript string `'40 + 2'` using a `generate` function.

Here's how the Node.js package can be implemented:

```javascript
// Install the package through npm: npm install escodegen

const escodegen = require('escodegen');

/**
 * Generates JavaScript code from an AST.
 *
 * @param {Object} ast - The Abstract Syntax Tree representing the code.
 * @returns {string} - The generated JavaScript code.
 */
function generateCode(ast) {
    return escodegen.generate(ast);
}

// Example usage
const ast = {
    type: 'BinaryExpression',
    operator: '+',
    left: { type: 'Literal', value: 40 },
    right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2 }
};

console.log(generateCode(ast));  // Output: '40 + 2'

// Export the generateCode function for external use
module.exports = {
    generateCode
};
```

Instructions for building a browser bundle and running tests can be implemented using npm scripts. The required `escodegen` library should be installed as a dependency in the `package.json` file. Here is an example of potential scripts added to a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "escodegen-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "JavaScript code generator from AST",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "browserify index.js > escodegen.browser.js",
    "build-min": "browserify index.js | terser > escodegen.browser.min.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "BSD-2-Clause",
  "dependencies": {
    "escodegen": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "browserify": "^17.0.0",
    "terser": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

This `package.json` includes the necessary tools to compile the project for browser environments using `browserify` and to minify the output using `terser`. The `build` and `build-min` scripts assist in creating bundle and minified versions of the library for use in applications outside of Node.js environments.

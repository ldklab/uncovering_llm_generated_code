The Node.js package described in the README.md provides constants for semantic conventions to be used with the OpenTelemetry SDK/APIs. These conventions define standard attributes for tracing, and the package organizes them into two categories: stable and unstable (incubating) conventions. The structure of the package allows developers to import semantic conventions that suit their needs, with assurance of stability for the main export and more flexible, but potentially breaking changes for the incubating export.

### Functionality:
1. **Stable Conventions**: These are constants that follow strict semantic versioning, ensuring compatibility and non-breaking changes across versions. The developer uses these constants to add standard attributes to OpenTelemetry spans, such as network peer details and protocol information.

2. **Unstable Conventions**: These are constants that include both stable and experimental attributes. They allow more flexibility but do not guarantee non-breaking changes in minor releases. These may define attributes for processes such as commands and arguments.

### Usage:
- **Stable Semantic Conventions**: Developers can import constants specific to network attributes like peer address, port, protocol name, and version. This is illustrated by setting attributes on a span dealing with network connections.

- **Unstable Semantic Conventions**: Developers can import constants that help describe process-level details, such as commands and arguments. This is shown by setting attributes on a span capturing command line operations. 

Here is the implementation code for the described functionality:

```javascript
// index.js
const STABLE_CONVENTIONS = {
  ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_ADDRESS: 'net.peer.address',
  ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_PORT: 'net.peer.port',
  ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_NAME: 'net.protocol.name',
  ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION: 'net.protocol.version',
  ATTR_NETWORK_TRANSPORT: 'net.transport',
  NETWORK_TRANSPORT_VALUE_TCP: 'tcp',
};

const INCUBATING_CONVENTIONS = {
  ...STABLE_CONVENTIONS,
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND: 'process.command',
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_ARGS: 'process.command_args',
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_LINE: 'process.command_line',
};

module.exports = {
  ...STABLE_CONVENTIONS,
  '/incubating': INCUBATING_CONVENTIONS,
};

// Usage

// stableConventions.js
const {
  ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_ADDRESS,
  ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_PORT,
  ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_NAME,
  ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
  ATTR_NETWORK_TRANSPORT,
  NETWORK_TRANSPORT_VALUE_TCP,
} = require('./index');

function createNetworkSpan(tracer, spanName, spanOptions) {
  const span = tracer.startSpan(spanName, spanOptions)
    .setAttributes({
      [ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_ADDRESS]: 'localhost',
      [ATTR_NETWORK_PEER_PORT]: 8080,
      [ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_NAME]: 'http',
      [ATTR_NETWORK_PROTOCOL_VERSION]: '1.1',
      [ATTR_NETWORK_TRANSPORT]: NETWORK_TRANSPORT_VALUE_TCP,
    });
  return span;
}

// incubatingConventions.js
const { 
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND,
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_ARGS,
  ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_LINE,
} = require('./index')['/incubating'];

function createProcessSpan(tracer, spanName, spanOptions) {
  const span = tracer.startSpan(spanName, spanOptions)
    .setAttributes({
      [ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND]: 'cat',
      [ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_ARGS]: ['file1', 'file2'],
      [ATTR_PROCESS_COMMAND_LINE]: 'cat file1 file2',
    });
  return span;
}
```

This code provides two separate export paths for stable and incubating conventions, enabling developers to include semantic conventions in their OpenTelemetry traces programmatically.

The `socket.io-client` package is a JavaScript implementation for establishing WebSocket connections between the client's web browser and the server using the Socket.IO library. It provides the functionality to connect, communicate, and handle real-time events efficiently over WebSockets.

### Explanation of the Functionality:
- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of `socket.io-client` is to allow clients to establish and maintain a WebSocket connection to a Socket.IO server. This connection is used to send and receive messages and events between the client and server in real-time.
- **Setup:** It can be included in a web application by installing it through the NPM (Node Package Manager), which will allow you to start using it to create WebSocket connections.
- **Debugging:** It offers a simple way to enable detailed debugging information. By setting `localStorage.debug = '*'` in the browser console, it will log all debug outputs, making troubleshooting and understanding the connection lifecycle and message traffic easier.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available, offering guidance on client initialization, event handling, and error management.
- **License:** The package is open-source and is distributed under the MIT License, allowing for free and flexible use in both non-commercial and commercial projects.

### Implementation Code:

  "name": "socket.io-client-implementation",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple implementation of socket.io-client functionality",
  "main": "index.js",

```

```js
// index.js

const io = require('socket.io-client');

// Connect to the Socket.IO server
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

// Listen for a connection event
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to server');

  // Send a message to the server
  socket.emit('message', 'Hello, Socket.IO server!');

  // Listening for server messages
  socket.on('serverMessage', (data) => {
    console.log('Message from server:', data);
  });
});

// Listen for a disconnect event
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from server');
});

// Error handling
socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
  console.error('Connection error:', error);
});
```

In this implementation code, a simple Node.js package initializes a socket connection to a server running on `http://localhost:3000`, sending and receiving messages while handling connection events and errors.

The functionality described in the `Nodemailer` package README.md pertains to enabling the sending of emails from a Node.js application. Nodemailer is a module that abstracts the complexities of email sending through SMTP, allowing developers to easily integrate email functionality into their applications. Here's a concise summary of the key functionalities and issues discussed in the README:

1. **Basic Setup**: Users are shown how to configure SMTP settings, including the host and port of the SMTP server, and the use of TLS for secure connections. 

2. **Node.js Version Compatibility**: The package works with Node.js versions starting from v6.0.0, leveraging modern JavaScript syntaxes like the spread operator.

3. **Common Issues and Recommendations**:
   - **Gmail Specifics**: Gmail can be finicky with Nodemailer, and users are encouraged to consider alternative services if issues arise.
   - **ETIMEDOUT and Firewall**: Users should check their firewall settings or ISP restrictions if facing timeout issues or connection blocks.
   - **TLS and Security**: Clarification on how to handle TLS errors and correctly configure secure connections.
   - **DNS Resolution**: Details on how Nodemailer resolves DNS and how users can bypass by hardcoding IP addresses if needed.
   - **TypeScript Types**: Nodemailer is primarily a Node.js module, and for TypeScript issues, support is through third-party type definitions.

4. **Support and Troubleshooting**: Links and recommendations for where to find help or further documentation.

Based on this description, here is an implementation of a simple email send functionality with Nodemailer:

```javascript
// Install Nodemailer using: npm install nodemailer
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

// Async function to send email
async function sendEmail() {
    // Create a transporter object using the default SMTP transport
    let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: 'smtp.example.com', // Update with your SMTP host
        port: 587, // Use 465 for secure connection
        secure: false, // Use true for 465, false for other ports
        auth: {
            user: 'your_username', // Update with your SMTP username
            pass: 'your_password'  // Update with your SMTP password
        },
        tls: {
            rejectUnauthorized: true, // Ensure certificate is valid
            minVersion: 'TLSv1.2' // Use at least TLS 1.2
        }
    });

    // Send mail with defined transport object
    let info = await transporter.sendMail({
        from: '"Sender Name" <sender@example.com>', // Sender address
        to: 'recipient@example.com', // List of receivers
        subject: 'Hello âœ”', // Subject line
        text: 'Hello world?', // Plain text body
        html: '<b>Hello world?</b>' // HTML body
    });

    console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
    // Preview URL not available in production
    console.log('Preview URL: %s', nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info));
}

// Call the function to send email
sendEmail().catch(console.error);
```

This code sets up a basic email sending operation using Nodemailer by configuring the SMTP server details like the host, port, and authentication credentials. The `sendEmail()` function encapsulates the email configuration and sending process. The example also demonstrates basic error handling via promise rejections caught by `catch(console.error)`.

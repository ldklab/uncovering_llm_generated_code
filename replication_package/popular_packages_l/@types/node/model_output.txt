The README.md explains the functionality of a Node.js package that provides type definitions for Node.js. Type definitions are files that allow TypeScript or other tools to understand the types used by a JavaScript library or application, thereby enabling type checking and better developer tooling.

- **Installation:** The package can be installed via npm with the command `npm install --save @types/node`.
- **Summary:** This package comprises type definitions specifically for the Node.js runtime environment, allowing developers to use Node.js-specific APIs and constructs with type safety.
- **Details:** The package's definitions are sourced from the DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository, a community-driven source for providing TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries.
- **Additional Details:** The readme mentions that the package depends on another type package named `undici-types` and lists the date of its last update.
- **Credits:** It acknowledges the many contributors who have worked on these type definitions, including individuals and organizations like Microsoft TypeScript and NodeJS Contributors.

Now, here's a simple implementation of a Node.js package that mimics the organization and structure of a type definition package as outlined, using placeholders and examples:

```markdown
# @types/my-node
## Installation
> `npm install --save @types/my-node`

## Summary
This package contains type definitions for a hypothetical Node.js module.

## Details
Files for this package can be found in a specified GitHub repository (hypothetically).

```typescript
// index.d.ts

// Example of a simple type definition file
declare module 'my-node-module' {
    
    // Example of a type alias
    type MyStringType = string;

    // Example of an interface
    interface MyObject {
        prop1: string;
        prop2?: number;
    }

    // Example of a function
    function myFunction(input: MyStringType): MyObject;

    // Default export
    export default myFunction;
}
```

```typescript
// my-node-module.js (hypothetical implementation of module for reference)

function myFunction(input) {
    // Hypothetical implementation
    return {
        prop1: input,
        prop2: Math.random() * 100
    }
}

module.exports = myFunction;
```
```

This package setup provides type definitions for a hypothetical Node.js module named `my-node-module`. It defines types, interfaces, and functions using TypeScript syntax in a manner similar to what the `@types/node` package does for Node.js core modules.

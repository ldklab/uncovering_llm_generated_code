The README.md file for the `@aws-sdk/util-user-agent-browser` package provides very minimal information about its functionality. From the context provided, it's an internal package used for handling user-agent functionality specifically intended for browsers within the AWS SDK ecosystem. However, it lacks any detailed explanation or examples on how to use it, instead advising against direct usage, indicating that it's likely intended to be used within other parts of the AWS SDK rather than by external developers directly.

Given this, we can infer that the package likely manages or creates a user-agent string customized for AWS SDK's usage in browser environments. These user-agent strings are typically used to identify the application making HTTP requests to AWS services.

Now, let's create a simple Node.js package that mirrors such functionality by generating a user-agent string meant for browser-based use, potentially including information like the browser name, version, language, and other relevant details.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "name": "@aws-sdk/util-user-agent-browser",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An internal package for handling user agent strings in browsers for the AWS SDK",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {},
  "dependencies": {}
}

// index.js
class UserAgentGenerator {
  static getUserAgent() {
    const userAgent = typeof navigator !== 'undefined' ? navigator.userAgent : 'node';
    const platform = typeof navigator !== 'undefined' ? navigator.platform : 'Node.js';
    const language = typeof navigator !== 'undefined' ? navigator.language : 'en-US';

    return `aws-sdk-browser/1.0 (${platform}; ${language}) ${userAgent}`;
  }
}

module.exports = { UserAgentGenerator };

// example.js
const { UserAgentGenerator } = require('./index.js');

console.log(UserAgentGenerator.getUserAgent());
```

In this implementation, the package exports a `UserAgentGenerator` class with a static method `getUserAgent`. This method checks if it's running in a browser environment by looking for the `navigator` object and retrieves properties such as `userAgent`, `platform`, and `language`. These are then formatted into a user-agent string that could be used for tracking purposes by AWS services when accessed via a browser. If run in a Node.js environment, it defaults to simpler static values.

The `@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc` package is part of the AWS SDK for JavaScript and provides a client to interact with the AWS SSO OIDC service for Node.js, browser, and React Native applications. It allows you to facilitate OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flows for AWS IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO).

### Key Features and Capabilities:
1. **Client Registration**: The client can register with the AWS SSO OIDC to obtain access tokens via different commands.
2. **Token Management**: The service supports commands to create tokens that allow accessing assigned AWS resources and account entitlements.
3. **Device Authorization**: The service implements OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant for CLI-based single sign-on authentication.
4. **Compatibility**: The service is compatible with both older and newer CLI versions, but newer CLI versions offer enhanced functionalities like token refresh without re-authentication.
5. **Modular SDK**: The package is modular, meaning you import only the clients and commands you need, which can result in smaller bundle sizes.

### Usage:
- Import the `SSOOIDCClient` and required command(s).
- Initialize the `SSOOIDCClient` with necessary configurations (e.g., region).
- Create a command instance with required parameters.
- Use the client to send the command and process the results.

### Code Example:
Here's a basic overview of how you would utilize this package to make an API call to create a token:

```javascript
// Importing necessary components from the package
const { SSOOIDCClient, CreateTokenCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc");

// Initialize the client
const client = new SSOOIDCClient({ region: "us-west-2" });

// Define input parameters for the CreateTokenCommand
const params = {
  // Example parameters for token creation
  clientId: "yourClientId",
  clientSecret: "yourClientSecret",
  grantType: "authorization_code",
  // Add other necessary parameters
};

// Create an instance of the command
const command = new CreateTokenCommand(params);

// Define an async function to execute the command
async function createToken() {
  try {
    // Sending the command
    const data = await client.send(command);
    console.log("Token Data: ", data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    console.error("Error creating token: ", error);
  }
}

// Call the function
createToken();
```

This example demonstrates how to set up and use the `SSOOIDCClient` to handle OIDC token requests. It guides you through importing the client and commands, setting up configurations, and defining operations to interact with AWS SSO OIDC in an asynchronous manner.

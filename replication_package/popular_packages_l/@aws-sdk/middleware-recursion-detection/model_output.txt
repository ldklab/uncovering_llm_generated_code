The npm package `@aws-sdk/middleware-recursion-detection` suggests that it is intended for internal use within an AWS SDK ecosystem, and not intended for direct use by most developers. The brevity of the README.md file, along with the advice against direct usage, implies that this middleware package's main function is to detect "recursion" within requests or operations being called within an AWS SDK context. Recursion, in this scenario, might refer to the repeated or cyclic invocation of SDK operations which can lead to unexpected behaviors or issues.

The "middleware" in the package indicates that it acts as an intermediary to process requests or responses, possibly augmenting them with functionality related to recursion detection, ensuring SDK operations execute smoothly without unintended self-references.

Given this explanation, a possible implementation could involve intercepting requests in the AWS SDK, tracking operation call stacks, and flagging or handling cases where recursion is detected.

Now, here is a mock-up implementation code for such a functionality:

```javascript
// index.js

class RecursionDetectionError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'RecursionDetectionError';
  }
}

class RecursionDetectionMiddleware {
  constructor() {
    // This map holds counts of operation calls to detect recursion
    this.operationStack = new Map();
  }

  handle(request, next) {
    const operationName = request.operationName;

    // Track the current operation count
    this.operationStack.set(
      operationName, 
      (this.operationStack.get(operationName) || 0) + 1
    );

    try {
      if (this.operationStack.get(operationName) > 1) {
        throw new RecursionDetectionError(`Recursion detected in operation: ${operationName}`);
      }

      return next(request); // Pass request to the next middleware/handler
    } finally {
      // Decrement operation count after processing
      this.operationStack.set(
        operationName, 
        this.operationStack.get(operationName) - 1
      );
    }
  }
}

// Middleware application function
function applyRecursionDetectionMiddleware(client) {
  const middleware = new RecursionDetectionMiddleware();
  client.addMiddleware((request, next) => middleware.handle(request, next));
}

// Usage (hypothetical)
// Considering there's an AWS SDK client that supports middleware

// const client = getAwsSdkClientSomehow();
// applyRecursionDetectionMiddleware(client);

// Exporting for testing purposes or further implementation
module.exports = {
  RecursionDetectionMiddleware,
  applyRecursionDetectionMiddleware,
  RecursionDetectionError,
};
```

This is a simple simulation of middleware that monitors recursive behavior through a stack count mechanism. It raises an error if any operation is detected to be recursively called. The example also includes a utility to apply this middleware to an AWS-style client.

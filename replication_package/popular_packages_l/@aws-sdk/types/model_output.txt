The README.md snippet provided for the Node.js package `@aws-sdk/types` includes two badge images. These badges provide metadata about the package:

1. **NPM Version Badge**: This badge displays the latest version of the `@aws-sdk/types` package available on npm. It is a visual indicator for the user to know what the most current version of the package is. Clicking on this badge directs users to the package's npm page where they can find more detailed information and documentation.

2. **NPM Downloads Badge**: This badge shows the number of downloads of the `@aws-sdk/types` package over the past month. This is useful for users to gauge the popularity and usage of the package. Similarly, clicking on this badge will take users to the npm page for more insights into the download statistics over time.

These badges are meant to be simple indicators of the package's current version and usage metrics, typically used in documentation or package descriptions to give users a quick overview of package status and reliability.

Now let's generate the code for such a functionality:

```markdown
# @aws-sdk/types

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@aws-sdk/types/latest.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/types)
[![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@aws-sdk/types.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/types)

This package provides essential types used by AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js or browser environments. The types defined in this package should help developers build applications with a clear understanding of the expected structure and functionality of the AWS SDK modules they are working with.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```sh
npm install @aws-sdk/types
```

## Usage

```javascript
// Import specific types from the package
import { SomeType, AnotherType } from '@aws-sdk/types';

// Use the types in your AWS SDK related implementation
function processAWSData(input: SomeType): AnotherType {
    // implementation logic here
}
```

## Overview

The `@aws-sdk/types` package provides TypeScript type definitions used for:

- AWS service client configuration.
- Request and response handling.

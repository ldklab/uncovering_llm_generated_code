This code snippet consists of a Node.js setup that exports a map of color names to their corresponding RGB values. The `colorName` object contains several key-value pairs where each key is the name of a common color, and each value is an array of three values representing its RGB (red, green, blue) components. The color data is exported from `index.js` as a module, which can then be imported and used to check RGB values by referring to the color name keys, as demonstrated in the usage example with `colors.red`.

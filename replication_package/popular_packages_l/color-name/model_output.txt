The functionality described in the README.md provides a simple Node.js package that exports a JSON object mapping color names to their corresponding RGB values. The RGB values are represented as arrays of three numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, corresponding to the intensities of red, green, and blue, respectively.

Here's how the package works:
1. The package exports an object where each key is a color name (e.g., "red") and its value is an array representing the RGB values of that color.
2. Users can import this package and access colors using their names, like `colors.red`, which returns `[255, 0, 0]` for red.

Now, let's implement this functionality:

```markdown
// package.json
{
  "name": "color-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module"
}

// index.js
const colorName = {
  "red": [255, 0, 0],
  "green": [0, 128, 0],
  "blue": [0, 0, 255],
  "black": [0, 0, 0],
  "white": [255, 255, 255],
  "gray": [128, 128, 128],
  "yellow": [255, 255, 0],
  "cyan": [0, 255, 255],
  "magenta": [255, 0, 255],
  // Add more colors as necessary, following the CSS Color Module Level 4 specification
};

export default colorName;

// Usage Example
import colors from './index.js'; // Assuming the module is locally stored as index.js
console.log(colors.red); // Outputs: [255, 0, 0]
```

This code creates a simple module that when imported provides a list of named colors and their respective RGB arrays, as specified in the CSS Color Module Level 4. Users can easily access predefined colors and their RGB values by importing the module and calling the color names.

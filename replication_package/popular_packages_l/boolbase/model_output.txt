The `boolbase` Node.js package is a very simple module that provides two basic functions: `trueFunc` and `falseFunc`. These functions are used to always return `true` and `false`, respectively.

The main purpose of these functions is optimization. By creating single instances of these functions, instead of defining new functions each time, you can reuse them across different modules or libraries to optimize performance. For instance, in the case of the `CSSselect` library, these functions might be used to quickly determine whether a CSS selector will match any elements. If it doesn't match anything, certain operations like DOM traversal can be skipped, optimizing the code execution.

The reason for having these functions in a separate module is to promote modularization and reuse. As different modules rely on these functions, having them in a centralized module like `boolbase` ensures that they are consistent and helps reduce redundancy in codebases that incorporate the `CSSselect` library or other utilities requiring this functionality.

Here is the implementation of the `boolbase` Node.js package:

```javascript
// boolbase/index.js

// Function that always returns true
function trueFunc() {
  return true;
}

// Function that always returns false
function falseFunc() {
  return false;
}

// Export the functions as module exports
module.exports = {
  trueFunc,
  falseFunc
};
```

To use this package, you would typically install it via npm and then require it in your Node.js application like so:

```javascript
const boolbase = require('boolbase');

console.log(boolbase.trueFunc());  // Outputs: true
console.log(boolbase.falseFunc()); // Outputs: false
```

This simple package provides reusable, efficient, and easy-to-understand functions for boolean value operations across multiple modules or projects.

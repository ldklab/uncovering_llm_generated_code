The functionality described in the Inquirer.js package README focuses on providing a collection of command line user interfaces for Node.js. The package is designed to facilitate interactions in command line applications by:

1. Asking users questions through various prompts.
2. Providing feedback and parsing input.
3. Validating answers collected from users.
4. Managing hierarchical question prompts.

The package includes several standard prompt types like input, confirm, list, rawlist, expand, checkbox, password, editor, and others. These prompts can be extended or customized, and the package even allows users to create new ones using plugins.

Inquirer.js also supports some degree of asynchronous operations, allowing dynamic question flows by using reactive extensions. It's designed to be used in interactive environments but gracefully handles errors when deployed in non-interactive setups.

Here's a basic implementation of the Inquirer.js functionality:

```javascript
// Importing necessary modules
const readline = require('readline');

// Creating a readline interface
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Prompting utility function
function prompt(question, callback) {
  rl.question(`${question}\n> `, (answer) => {
    callback(answer);
  });
}

// Handling different prompt types
function askQuestions(questions) {
  let index = 0;
  const answers = {};

  const processQuestion = () => {
    if (index < questions.length) {
      const question = questions[index];
      prompt(`${question.message}`, (answer) => {
        answers[question.name] = answer || question.default;
        index++;
        processQuestion();
      });
    } else {
      rl.close();
      console.log("Collected Answers:", answers);
    }
  };

  processQuestion();
}

// Example questions array
const questions = [
  {
    type: 'input',
    name: 'name',
    message: 'What is your name?',
    default: 'User'
  },
  {
    type: 'confirm',
    name: 'continue',
    message: 'Do you want to continue?',
    default: 'yes'
  }
];

// Initiate the asking process
askQuestions(questions);
```

This code provides a simple command line interface using Node.js's `readline` module. It doesn't cover all the features of Inquirer.js but serves as a basic structure to prompt users with questions and collect their input in a CLI environment. You can expand upon it by adding more prompt types, async capabilities, and input validation as needed.

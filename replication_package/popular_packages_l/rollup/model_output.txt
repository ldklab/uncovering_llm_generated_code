The Node.js package described in the README.md is for a tool called "Rollup", which is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. Rollup compiles smaller pieces of ES module format code into larger bundles optimized for either legacy or modern environments. It supports different output formats including ES modules, CommonJS, UMD, and IIFE. Rollup offers tree-shaking capabilities to include only the code that is actually used, thereby reducing the bundle size. The package can be installed globally via npm and used through a command-line interface or JavaScript API with a configuration file. It also supports the integration of existing CommonJS modules through plugins and facilitates publishing ES modules for compatibility with CommonJS tools.

Below is the code for a simple Node.js package illustrating the setup of Rollup to create a module bundle targeting different environments:

```markdown
# File Structure
- my-rollup-package/
  - src/
    - main.js
  - rollup.config.js
  - package.json

# File: package.json
{
  "name": "my-rollup-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Rollup setup example",
  "main": "bundle.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "rollup": "^3.0.0"
  }
}

# File: rollup.config.js
export default {
  input: 'src/main.js',
  output: [
    {
      file: 'bundle.iife.js',
      format: 'iife',
      name: 'MyBundle'
    },
    {
      file: 'bundle.cjs.js',
      format: 'cjs'
    },
    {
      file: 'bundle.umd.js',
      format: 'umd',
      name: 'MyBundle'
    }
  ]
}

# File: src/main.js
// Example ES module
export function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}

# To Build:
# 1. Install dependencies: npm install
# 2. Run build script: npm run build
# This will generate three bundles: bundle.iife.js, bundle.cjs.js, bundle.umd.js
```

In this setup:
- The `rollup.config.js` file specifies the entry point (`main.js`) and output configurations for different module formats (IIFE, CommonJS, and UMD).
- A simple function `helloWorld` is exported from `main.js` which will be bundled according to the configurations specified.
- To build the project, dependencies need to be installed using `npm install`, and the build process is executed using the `npm run build` script which triggers Rollup to generate the specified bundles. 

This setup captures the basic use of Rollup as described in the README.md, enabling users to bundle their modular ES code into various formats for different environments.

The provided Node.js code exports a function named `abbrev` which takes any number of string arguments. The purpose of this function is to generate an object where each key is a unique abbreviation of the words, and the value is the fully expanded word that the abbreviation corresponds to.

Here's how the code works:
1. It uses the `arguments` object to accept multiple string arguments and stores them in an array called `words`.
2. The words are sorted alphabetically to ensure consistent abbreviation generation.
3. For each word in the sorted list, it attempts to create abbreviations by slicing the word incrementally.
4. It initially checks if the abbreviation (or the full word if the slice length is zero) is already a key in the `abbrevs` object.
5. If an abbreviation is not yet in the dictionary, it is added with the full word as the value.
6. If the key already exists and maps to a different word, it continues to incrementally increase the abbreviation's length until a unique abbreviation is found and assigned in the `abbrevs` object.

In essence, the function constructs an object of potentially minimal keys representing words such that each abbreviation corresponds uniquely to a word from the input.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
function abbrev(...words) {
  const abbrevs = {};
  const sortedWords = words.sort();

  sortedWords.forEach((word) => {
    let expandedWord = word;
    let unique = false;
    let j = 0;
    
    while (!unique && j <= expandedWord.length) {
      const key = expandedWord.slice(0, j) || expandedWord;

      if (!abbrevs[key]) {
        abbrevs[key] = expandedWord;
        unique = true;
      } else if (abbrevs[key] !== expandedWord) {
        j++;
      } else {
        unique = true;
      }
    }
  });

  return abbrevs;
}

module.exports = abbrev;
```

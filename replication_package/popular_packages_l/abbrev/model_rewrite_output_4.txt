The provided Node.js code defines a function `abbrev` which takes a variable number of string arguments. Its purpose is to generate a map of abbreviations for the given words where each abbreviation is a unique substring starting from the first character of each word. It returns an object where the keys represent the generated abbreviations and the values represent the original words they map to. Each abbreviation is guaranteed to be unique. If an abbreviation conflict is detected (i.e., two words share the same abbreviation), the function keeps appending subsequent characters from the word until a unique identifier emerges. Finally, the function is exported as a module.

Here is a possible rewrite according to the explanation:

```javascript
function createAbbreviations(...words) {
  const abbreviationsMap = {};
  const sortedWords = words.sort();

  sortedWords.forEach(word => {
    let abbreviation = '';

    for (let i = 0; i <= word.length; i++) {
      abbreviation = word.slice(0, i) || word;

      if (!abbreviationsMap.hasOwnProperty(abbreviation)) {
        abbreviationsMap[abbreviation] = word;
      } else {
        while (abbreviationsMap[abbreviation] !== word) {
          i++;
          abbreviation = word.slice(0, i);
          abbreviationsMap[abbreviation] = word;
        }
      }
    }
  });

  return abbreviationsMap;
}

module.exports = createAbbreviations;
```

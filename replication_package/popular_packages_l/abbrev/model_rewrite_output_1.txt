The provided Node.js function, `abbrev`, generates a set of possible abbreviations for a given list of words. Here's how it works:

1. **Sort Words**: It first sorts the given words alphabetically to ensure that abbreviations are consistent.
2. **Generate Abbreviations**: For each word, it generates potential abbreviations starting from the shortest prefix and saves them in an object as keys. The full word is stored as the value corresponding to each key.
3. **Handle Conflicts**: If a potential abbreviation for a word conflicts (i.e., is the same as an abbreviation for a previously encountered word), it increases the size of the prefix until the abbreviation is unique for that word.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns an object with keys as abbreviations and values as their associated full words.

Below is a rewritten version of the given code, keeping the functionality intact:

```javascript
function abbrev(...words) {
  const abbrevs = {};
  const sortedWords = words.sort();

  sortedWords.forEach((word) => {
    let expandedWord = word;

    for (let j = 0; j <= expandedWord.length; j++) {
      let key = expandedWord.slice(0, j) || expandedWord;

      if (!abbrevs.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        abbrevs[key] = expandedWord;
      } else {
        while (abbrevs[key] !== expandedWord) {
          j++;
          key = expandedWord.slice(0, j);
          abbrevs[key] = expandedWord;
        }
      }
    }
  });

  return abbrevs;
}

module.exports = abbrev;
```

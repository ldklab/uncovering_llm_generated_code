The provided Node.js code sets up a basic development environment using Webpack, Webpack CLI, and Webpack Dev Server. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Dependencies:** The code begins with a comment indicating the need to install `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, and `webpack-dev-server` using npm for development purposes.

2. **Webpack Configuration (`webpack.config.js`):** 
   - **Entry Point:** The configuration specifies `./src/index.js` as the entry point of the application. This is where Webpack starts building the dependency graph.
   - **Output:** The processed files are bundled into a file named `bundle.js` in the `dist` directory.
   - **Dev Server Settings:**
     - Serves files from the `./dist` directory.
     - Enables gzip compression for better performance.
     - Listens on port 8080.
     - Supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updating of modules in the browser without a full reload.
     - Automatically opens the default web browser when the server starts.
   - **Module Rules:** It includes a rule to process `.js` files (excluding the `node_modules` directory) using `babel-loader`, which transpiles JavaScript files with Babel to ensure compatibility with older JavaScript environments.

3. **NPM Script and Dependencies (`package.json`):**
   - A script is defined as `"serve": "webpack serve --config webpack.config.js"`, allowing the server to be started with `npm run serve`.
   - Lists `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `webpack-dev-server`, `babel-loader`, and Babel packages as development dependencies.

4. **Source File (`src/index.js`):** Contains a basic JavaScript file with a console log statement.

The rewrite below maintains this structure and configuration:

```js
// Install necessary packages using:
// npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev

// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js', // Entry file of the application
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js', // Output bundle filename
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist') // Output directory
  },
  devServer: {
    static: './dist', // Serve static files from the dist directory
    compress: true, // Enable gzip compression
    port: 8080, // Port for the dev server
    hot: true, // Enable Hot Module Replacement
    open: true, // Open browser on server start
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/, // Target JavaScript files
        exclude: /node_modules/, // Exclude node_modules
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader', // Use Babel loader
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};

// package.json

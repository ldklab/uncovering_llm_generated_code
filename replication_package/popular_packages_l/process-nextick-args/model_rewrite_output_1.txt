The provided Node.js code defines a custom module that exports an object with a `nextTick` function. The `nextTick` function is a utility for scheduling a callback to be invoked in the next iteration of the Node.js event loop using `process.nextTick()`. It allows you to pass the callback function (`fn`) along with additional arguments. If any additional arguments are supplied, they are packaged into an array (`args`) and passed to the callback using `Function.prototype.apply()`. If no additional arguments are given, the callback is scheduled without them.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
// process-nextick-args/index.js

module.exports = {
  nextTick: function (fn, ...args) {
    if (args.length === 0) {
      return process.nextTick(fn);
    } else {
      return process.nextTick(() => {
        fn(...args);
      });
    }
  }
};
```

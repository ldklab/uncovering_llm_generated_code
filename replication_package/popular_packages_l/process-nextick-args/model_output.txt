The `process-nextick-args` Node.js package provides a utility that allows you to consistently use the `process.nextTick` function to schedule callbacks, regardless of the platform you are working on. The main feature of this library is that it ensures you can pass arguments to the callbacks of `process.nextTick`, a feature that is not uniformly supported across all platforms in Node.js. 

Here's how it works:
- You import the module using `require('process-nextick-args')`.
- Use the `nextTick` function exported by this module, passing in the callback function and any arguments you want to pass to it.
- The package internally handles the differences in how `process.nextTick` handles arguments across different Node.js versions and platforms, ensuring that the callback receives the provided arguments correctly.

Below is the implementation of the `process-nextick-args` package code in Node.js:

```js
// process-nextick-args/index.js

module.exports = {
  nextTick: function (fn) {
    var args = new Array(arguments.length - 1);
    for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
      args[i - 1] = arguments[i];
    }
    if (args.length === 0) {
      return process.nextTick(fn);
    } else {
      return process.nextTick(function () {
        fn.apply(null, args);
      });
    }
  }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Module Export**: The package exports an object with a single method `nextTick`.
2. **nextTick Method**: 
   - It takes a function `fn` as its first argument, followed by any number of additional arguments.
   - These additional arguments (`a, b, c, ...`) are stored in an array `args`.
   - If no additional arguments are provided, it simply schedules `fn` to be called in the next tick of the event loop using `process.nextTick(fn)`.
   - If additional arguments are provided, it uses `process.nextTick` to schedule a new function that calls `fn` with those arguments applied to it using `fn.apply(null, args)`.
3. **Cross-Version/Platform Compatibility**: This implementation ensures compatibility with environments where passing arguments directly to `process.nextTick` might not be supported, making it an essential utility for consistent asynchronous calls across different Node.js versions and environments.

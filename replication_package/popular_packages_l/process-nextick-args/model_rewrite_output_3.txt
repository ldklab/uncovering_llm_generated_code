The provided Node.js code exports an object with a single method called `nextTick`. This method schedules a function (`fn`) to run in the next iteration of the event loop using `process.nextTick`. If additional arguments are passed to `nextTick`, it collects them into an array and uses them when calling `fn` in the subsequent tick. In simpler terms, it allows `fn` to execute asynchronously with arguments passing capability.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
// process-nextick-args/index.js

module.exports = {
  nextTick: function (fn, ...args) {
    if (args.length === 0) {
      return process.nextTick(fn);
    } else {
      return process.nextTick(() => fn(...args));
    }
  }
};
```

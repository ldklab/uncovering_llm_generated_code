The `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` is a Babel plugin used to transform async and generator functions into a state machine. This allows these functions to be executed in JavaScript environments that do not natively support async and generator functions. 

When JavaScript code containing generator or async functions is processed by Babel with this plugin, the functions are converted to a structure that mimics the behavior of these functions using a state machine, making it compatible with older JavaScript engines.

The package can be installed via npm or yarn, both of which are package managers for JavaScript. The installation with the command `npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` or `yarn add @babel/plugin-transform-regenerator --dev`, adds the plugin as a development dependency, which means it is added to the `devDependencies` section of a project's `package.json` file. This section typically includes packages that are needed for the development and build process but not for the production environment.

The generation of code by this plugin involves:
1. Taking an `async` or `generator` function.
2. Converting it into a state machine.
3. Ensuring that the transformed code behaves like the original async or generator function.

Here is a simple example of how you would use this plugin in a custom implementation:

```javascript
// File: index.js

const babel = require('@babel/core');
const regenerator = require('@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator');

// A function to transform async/generator functions code
function transformAsyncGenerator(code) {
  const output = babel.transformSync(code, {
    plugins: [regenerator],
  });
  return output.code;
}

// Example usage
const inputCode = `
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  }

  function* counter() {
    let i = 0;
    while (true) {
      yield i++;
    }
  }
`;

const transformedCode = transformAsyncGenerator(inputCode);
console.log(transformedCode);
```

This code demonstrates how to use the Babel API to apply the `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` plugin to some input code. The function `transformAsyncGenerator` takes a string of JavaScript code, applies the transformation, and returns the transformed code string. The example includes an `async function` and a `generator function` that gets transformed when the script is executed.

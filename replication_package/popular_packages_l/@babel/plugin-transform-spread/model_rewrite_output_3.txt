The given Node.js code defines a function named `sum` that takes three arguments (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and returns their sum. It then creates an array called `numbers` with three elements: 1, 2, and 3. The code uses the spread operator `...` to unpack these elements and pass them as individual arguments to the `sum` function when calling it. The result of this operation is then logged to the console.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// Function that adds three numbers together
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

// Array of numbers to sum
const values = [1, 2, 3];

// Unpack array into individual arguments and print the sum
console.log(sum(...values));
```

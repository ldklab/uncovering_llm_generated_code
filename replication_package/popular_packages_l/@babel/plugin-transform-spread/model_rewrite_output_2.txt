The given Node.js code defines a function `sum` that takes three parameters, `x`, `y`, and `z`, and returns their sum. There is also an array `numbers` containing three numbers: `[1, 2, 3]`. The function `sum` is then called using the spread operator (`...`) with the `numbers` array, which expands the array into individual arguments for the function (`sum(1, 2, 3)`), and the result is logged to the console.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// Function to calculate the sum of three numbers
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c; // Returns the sum of the provided arguments
}

// Array containing three numbers
const nums = [1, 2, 3];

// Call the sum function with the spread operator to unpack array elements as arguments
const result = sum(...nums);

// Output the result to the console
console.log(result); // Expected output: 6
```

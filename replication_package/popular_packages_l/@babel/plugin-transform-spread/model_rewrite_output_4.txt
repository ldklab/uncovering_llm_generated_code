The Node.js code above defines a function `sum` that takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, and returns their sum. An array `numbers` containing three integers `[1, 2, 3]` is then defined. The `console.log` statement calls the `sum` function using the spread operator `...` to pass the elements of the `numbers` array as individual arguments to the `sum` function. Thus, the sum of the numbers in the array is calculated and logged to the console.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sum(...nums)); // Outputs the sum of the array elements
```

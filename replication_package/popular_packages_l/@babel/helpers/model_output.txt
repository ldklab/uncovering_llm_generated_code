The `@babel/helpers` package is a collection of utility functions that are used by Babel transforms during the process of code compilation and transformation. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript for current and older browsers or environments. This package provides pre-defined helper functions which Babel can use to perform various transformations more efficiently.

The package can be installed using npm or yarn as a development dependency, which means it is used during the development or build phase but not needed in the production environment.

Below is a simple implementation of a Node.js package that mimics the basic installation steps and provides a skeleton for what this package might look like with a single helper function example.

```javascript
// File: index.js (main entry point of the package)

class BabelHelpers {
  // A simple helper function example that the Babel transformer might use
  static extend(obj, extension) {
    return Object.assign({}, obj, extension);
  }

  // Placeholder for other possible helpers
  // static otherHelper() {
  //   // Implement other helpers as needed
  // }
}

module.exports = BabelHelpers;

// Usage example (This would be in a different file in practice)
const BabelHelpers = require('./index');

// Sample objects to demonstrate the extend helper
const baseObject = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const extensionObject = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const extendedObject = BabelHelpers.extend(baseObject, extensionObject);

console.log(extendedObject); // Output: { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

This implementation provides a fundamental structure with an example helper function `extend` that performs object extension using `Object.assign()`. The package exports the `BabelHelpers` class, which serves as a namespace for all helper functions that could be implemented. More helper functions can be added as needed to mimic the functionality of Babel's actual helper utilities. This initial setup is minimal and intended to show the installation process and a sample helper function without the full complexity of Babel's real implementation.

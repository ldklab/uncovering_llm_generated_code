The Node.js code provided is a Bash command that installs specific Babel packages using npm, which is the package manager for Node.js. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

- `npm install`: This command is used to install Node.js packages.
- `--save-dev`: This flag indicates that the packages will be added as development dependencies in your `package.json` file. These packages are necessary for developing and building the project but not for running the application in production.
- `@babel/core`: This is the core package of Babel. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript.
- `@babel/cli`: This package provides a command-line Babel interface to perform operations directly from the terminal.
- `@babel/preset-env`: This is a Babel preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environment(s).

Considering this explanation, here's a possible rewritten version of the code as a Node.js script that uses npm programmatically to achieve the same installation of dependencies:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Command to install Babel packages as development dependencies
const installCommand = 'npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env';

// Execute the command
exec(installCommand, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error executing command: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`Shell error: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Command Output:\n${stdout}`);
});
```

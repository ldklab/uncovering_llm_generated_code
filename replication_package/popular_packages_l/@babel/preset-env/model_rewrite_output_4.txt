The Node.js code provided is a command used with `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install specific Babel packages as development dependencies in a JavaScript or Node.js project. Here's a breakdown of each component:

- `npm install --save-dev`: This is the npm command to install packages as development dependencies, which means they are only required for development and not for the production environment.

- `@babel/core`: This is the core package for Babel, a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript today by converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

- `@babel/cli`: This is the Command Line Interface for Babel, allowing you to use Babel from the command line to transpile JavaScript files.

- `@babel/preset-env`: This package allows you to use the latest JavaScript features without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environment(s).

The command effectively adds Babel's core functionalities, CLI tools, and a recommended preset for transpiling modern JavaScript according to the desired browser's compatibility to the project's development dependencies.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```bash
# Install Babel as a development dependency with core features, CLI tools, and preset for environment
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
```

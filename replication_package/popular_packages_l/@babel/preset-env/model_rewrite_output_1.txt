The provided Node.js code is a command to install Babel and its related dependencies using npm. Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that enables developers to use the newest features of JavaScript, which may not yet be supported by all environments or browsers, by transpiling the code into a backward-compatible version. 

This specific command installs the following packages as development dependencies:

1. `@babel/core`: The core package of Babel responsible for parsing and transforming JavaScript code.
2. `@babel/cli`: The command-line interface for Babel, allowing developers to run Babel from the command line to compile files or directories.
3. `@babel/preset-env`: A smart preset that allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features by automatically determining the necessary Babel plugins and polyfills based on the project's target environments or presets.

Here's the rewritten code with the same functionality:

```bash
# Node.js command to install Babel core, CLI, and preset-env as development dependencies
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
```

The provided command installs specific packages needed for using Babel with a Node.js project. Here's a breakdown of each part:

- `npm install --save-dev`: This is a command to install one or more packages as development dependencies in a Node.js project. The `--save-dev` flag specifies that these packages are needed only during the development phase and not in production.

- `@babel/core`: This is the main library for Babel, a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features by converting them into a version compatible with older environments.

- `@babel/cli`: This is the Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for Babel, which allows developers to run Babel transformations via the command line.

- `@babel/preset-env`: This package is a smart preset that allows Babel to use the most recent ECMAScript features without having to micromanage which plugins are needed for specific JavaScript syntax.

The purpose of these packages is to set up Babel so that developers can use modern JavaScript syntax in their projects and ensure compatibility across different environments.

Here's a rewritten version of the original command:

```bash
# Command to install Babel packages for development purpose
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env
```

The `@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx` is a Babel plugin designed to enable the parsing of JSX syntax within your JavaScript code. JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React to describe UI components in a syntax similar to HTML. This plugin does not perform any transformation on the JSX code; it merely enables Babel to parse the JSX syntax. This is useful when you're incorporating other Babel plugins that perform transformations on JSX, as they may require that the syntax is first understood by Babel.

The package facilitates the parsing process by modifying Babel's parser with the capability to understand JSX constructs, making it ready for further processing or transformation by additional Babel plugins.

Here's how you would implement such a functionality in a Node.js package:

```javascript
// Import the required Babel types
const { declare } = require('@babel/helper-plugin-utils');

module.exports = declare((api) => {
  // Ensure the plugin works with the version of Babel being used
  api.assertVersion("^7.0.0");

  return {
    name: 'syntax-jsx',  // Plugin name
    
    // Introduce a new parser plugin for Babel to interpret JSX syntax
    manipulateOptions(opts, parserOpts) {
      // Add the 'jsx' parser plugin to the list of plugins in Babel's parser
      parserOpts.plugins.push('jsx');
    }
  };
});
```

This code exports a Babel plugin. The `declare` function from `@babel/helper-plugin-utils` is used to ensure compatibility with the version of Babel in use. The `manipulateOptions` function is responsible for pushing the `'jsx'` string into `parserOpts.plugins`, thereby enabling the JSX syntax parsing feature within Babel. The name of the plugin is designated as `'syntax-jsx'`.

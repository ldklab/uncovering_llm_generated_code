The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a function called `annotateAsPure`. This function is designed to annotate a given Babel AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) node or path with a `#__PURE__` comment. The purpose of this annotation is to indicate to tools such as minifiers that the function or expression represented by the node is side-effect-free, which allows for potential optimizations during the build process.

The function `annotateAsPure` performs the following actions:
1. Accepts either a node or a path object, which can be obtained from a Babel AST.
2. Checks if the node has an existing `leadingComments` array and initializes it if it doesn't.
3. Verifies if the `#__PURE__` annotation already exists in the leading comments to avoid duplication.
4. If the annotation is not present, it adds a new comment block containing the `#__PURE__` annotation.

Below is the rewritten code:

```javascript
const PURE_ANNOTATION = "#__PURE__";

/**
 * Add a `#__PURE__` annotation comment to a Babel AST node or path.
 *
 * @param {object} nodeOrPath - The Babel node or path object to annotate.
 */
function annotateAsPure(nodeOrPath) {
  const node = nodeOrPath.node || nodeOrPath;
  node.leadingComments = node.leadingComments || [];

  const hasPureAnnotation = node.leadingComments.some(
    comment => comment.value.includes(PURE_ANNOTATION)
  );

  if (!hasPureAnnotation) {
    node.leadingComments.push({
      type: "CommentBlock",
      value: ` ${PURE_ANNOTATION} `
    });
  }
}

module.exports = annotateAsPure;
```

The `@babel/preset-typescript` package is a Babel preset specifically designed to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript. Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features and syntaxes, as well as compile other languages like TypeScript into standard JavaScript.

### Functionality Explained

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: The primary purpose of this preset is to transform TypeScript, which is a typed superset of JavaScript, into JavaScript code. It strips out TypeScript-specific features such as type annotations, ensuring the resulting code runs in any JavaScript environment.

2. **Integration with Babel**: By using `@babel/preset-typescript`, developers can integrate TypeScript directly into their Babel workflow. This allows for a consistent build process alongside other Babel presets and plugins that may be used in the project for transforming JavaScript code.

3. **Ease of Use**: Installation of the package can be done using either npm or yarn, which are popular JavaScript package managers. Once installed, it can be incorporated into the Babel configuration to enable TypeScript support.

Below is a simple implementation of creating a Node.js package that uses `@babel/preset-typescript` to compile TypeScript code.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "typescript-babel-compiler",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js package to compile TypeScript using Babel.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel src --out-dir lib"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.16.0",
    "@babel/cli": "^7.16.0",
    "@babel/preset-typescript": "^7.16.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

```javascript
// babel.config.json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-typescript"]
}
```

```typescript
// src/index.ts (TypeScript source file)
type Greeting = {
  name: string;
};

function greet(person: Greeting): string {
  return `Hello, ${person.name}!`;
}

console.log(greet({ name: "Developer" }));
```

```sh
# bash commands to setup and build the project
npm install
npm run build
# This compiles the TypeScript source in 'src/' to JavaScript in 'lib/'
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **package.json**: This file includes all necessary metadata and dependencies for the Node.js package. It defines a build script that uses Babel to compile TypeScript files from the `src` directory to the `lib` directory.

- **babel.config.json**: This configuration file informs Babel to use the `@babel/preset-typescript` preset, allowing it to correctly handle TypeScript files during the compilation process.

- **src/index.ts**: A simple TypeScript file that includes a type definition (`Greeting`) and a function (`greet`) that uses it. This file serves as an example of TypeScript code that will be compiled.

- **Build Script**: Running `npm run build` utilizes Babel CLI to compile the TypeScript files based on the configuration provided. The output is JavaScript files located in the `lib` directory.

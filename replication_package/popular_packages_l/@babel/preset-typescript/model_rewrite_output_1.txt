- **Description**: It describes the package as "A simple Node.js package to compile TypeScript using Babel."
- **Main Entry**: The main entry point of the package is "index.js".
- **Scripts**: A script named "build" is defined that utilizes Babel to compile TypeScript files found in the "src" directory and outputs the compiled files into the "lib" directory.
- **Dependencies**: There are no runtime dependencies defined.

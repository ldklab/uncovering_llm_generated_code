The `istanbul-lib-source-maps` package is a library that provides source map support for istanbuljs, a popular JavaScript code coverage tool. A source map is a file that maps from the transformed source to the original source, allowing for better debugging and coverage reporting. This library uses the `debug` module for debugging purposes, which allows users to see debug output when they set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `istanbuljs`.

To implement this functionality, the package needs to:
1. Parse and handle source maps to support accurate code coverage reports.
2. Integrate with the `istanbuljs` family of libraries for providing source map support.
3. Implement debug support using the `debug` module, where setting the `DEBUG` environment variable outputs debug information to aid in development and troubleshooting.

Here's a simplified implementation of this functionality:

```js
// index.js
const debug = require('debug')('istanbuljs');
const { SourceMapConsumer } = require('source-map');

class IstanbulLibSourceMaps {
  constructor() {
    debug('Creating an instance of IstanbulLibSourceMaps');
    // Initialize any required state or properties
  }

  async processSourceMap(sourceMapContent) {
    debug('Processing source map');
    try {
      const consumer = await new SourceMapConsumer(sourceMapContent);
      // Process the source map content here
      const generatedPosition = consumer.generatedPositionFor({
        source: 'source.js', // original source file
        line: 1,             // line number in original source
        column: 0            // column number in original source
      });
      
      debug('Generated position:', generatedPosition);

      // Example usage of consumer, you may adapt it based on actual needs
      return {
        generatedLine: generatedPosition.line,
        generatedColumn: generatedPosition.column
      };

    } catch (error) {
      debug('Error processing source map:', error);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      // You can either call consumer.destroy() if you're using this
      // from an older `source-map` version or just pass with new ones
      if (typeof sourceMapContent.destroy === 'function') {
        sourceMapContent.destroy();
      }
    }
  }
}

module.exports = IstanbulLibSourceMaps;

// Usage example
if (require.main === module) {
  (async () => {
    const sourceMaps = new IstanbulLibSourceMaps();
    const result = await sourceMaps.processSourceMap({
      version: 3,
      file: 'out.js',
      sources: ['foo.js'],
      names: ['src', 'maps', 'are', 'fun'],
      mappings: 'AA,AB;;ABCDE;',
    });
    console.log('Result:', result);
  })();
}
```

Note: This implementation is basic and aimed at demonstrating the main functionality. In a real use-case, make sure to handle more robust parsing of actual source map files and their integration with istanbul reports. Libraries like `source-map` are typically used for working with source maps in Node.js.

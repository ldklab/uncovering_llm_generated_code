The Node.js package described in the README file is named "Jake," which is a JavaScript build tool designed for Node.js applications. Here's an explanation of its functionality based on the README:

1. **Purpose**: Jake facilitates build automation tasks for Node.js projects. It performs tasks similar to other build tools like Make, Rake, or Ant, but it's specific to JavaScript and Node.js environments.

2. **Installation and Usage**: 
   - Developers are required to install Node.js to use Jake.
   - The repository containing Jake can be cloned from GitHub, and dependencies are installed using npm.
   - Tests can be run to ensure everything is set up correctly.

3. **Development**:
   - The README indicates opportunities for contributing to the Jake codebase, providing basic steps for setting up the development environment.
   - Contributions can be made by downloading the repository, installing dependencies, and then running tests to verify the setup.

4. **License**: The software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software.

The following code is a basic implementation of Jake as described:

```javascript
// jake.js - A simple build automation tool for Node.js

const { exec } = require('child_process');
const fs = require('fs');

// Task storage
const tasks = {};

// Define a Jake task
function task(name, dependencies, action) {
  tasks[name] = { dependencies, action };
}

// Run the provided task
function run(taskName) {
  if (!tasks[taskName]) {
    console.error(`Task ${taskName} not found`);
    return;
  }

  const task = tasks[taskName];

  (function execute(deps) {
    if (deps.length === 0) {
      task.action();
    } else {
      const dep = deps.shift();
      run(dep);
      execute(deps);
    }
  })([...task.dependencies]);
}

// Example task definition
task('build', ['clean'], () => {
  console.log('Building the project...');
  // Simulate build with a shell command
  exec('echo "Building..."', (err) => {
    if (err) console.error('Build failed!', err);
  });
});

task('clean', [], () => {
  console.log('Cleaning the project...');
  // Simulate cleaning with a shell command
  exec('echo "Cleaning..."', (err) => {
    if (err) console.error('Clean failed!', err);
  });
});

// Read command-line arguments to run the task
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
if (args.length === 0) {
  console.error('No task specified');
} else {
  run(args[0]);
}

module.exports = { task };
```

This code provides a basic setup for defining and running tasks with dependencies, mimicking a simple build process. It uses Node.js to handle command execution and allows users to define tasks with dependencies. The example given includes 'build' and 'clean' tasks to demonstrate how tasks with dependencies can be defined and executed.

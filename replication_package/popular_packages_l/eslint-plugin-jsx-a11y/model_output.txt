The `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` package provides a set of accessibility-focused linting rules for JSX elements in React applications. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and how to use it:

### Purpose
The plugin performs static analysis of JSX code to identify potential accessibility issues. This helps developers ensure their React applications are more accessible. The plugin checks various attributes and roles to ensure they follow best practices for accessibility.

### Key Features
- **Rules**: Includes rules to enforce best practices for accessible content in JSX, such as ensuring elements have accessible names, valid ARIA properties, and proper role assignments.
- **Configurations**: Offers recommended and strict shareable ESLint configurations that users can extend in their projects to enable a predefined set of rules.
- **Custom Configurations**: Developers can customize rules in either legacy `.eslintrc` configurations or using the flat `eslint.config.js` style.
- **Component and Attribute Mapping**: Allows users to map custom components or attributes to accessible JSX elements and properties for better linting coverage.
- **Polymorphic Components**: Provides functionality to define polymorphic components that can dynamically change their rendered DOM element types.

### Usage
1. **Installation**: Requires ESLint to be installed in the project. Then, the plugin itself can be installed via npm or Yarn.
2. **Basic Configuration**: Add `"jsx-a11y"` to the plugins section and configure specific rules in your ESLint configuration file.
3. **Extend Recommended or Strict Configurations**: Easily enable a set of recommended rules using `extends`.

### Creating a New Rule
A script is provided to scaffold new custom rules if needed.

Here's the code for setting up the basic functionality of the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` package, including configurations:

```js
// Install ESLint and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
// npm install eslint eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --save-dev

// .eslintrc.json - A basic configuration file for ESLint using the plugin
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",   // Base ESLint recommended settings
    "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended" // Use the recommended rules from the plugin
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "jsx-a11y" // Define the plugin
  ],
  "rules": {
    // Custom rule settings can be added here
    // Customize specific plugin rules by their rule names
    "jsx-a11y/alt-text": "error", // Example rule overriding
    // ...
  },
  "settings": {
    "jsx-a11y": {
      "polymorphicPropName": "as",
      "components": {
        "CustomButton": "button", // Mapping custom components
        "MyLink": "a"
      },
      "attributes": {
        "for": ["htmlFor", "for"] // Attribute mapping example
      }
    }
  }
}

// eslint.config.js - Using flat config style (if using modern ESLint setup)
const jsxA11y = require('eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y');

module.exports = [
  {
    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'], // Pattern to apply configurations
    plugins: {
      'jsx-a11y': jsxA11y,
    },
    rules: {
      'jsx-a11y/alt-text': 'error'
      // Add other rules as needed; can also extend recommended sets
    },
    settings: {
      'jsx-a11y': {
        polymorphicPropName: 'as',
        // ...other settings
      }
    }
  }
];

// Note: Logic for checking the JSX elements and attributes according to WAI-ARIA guidelines must be implemented by the plugin internally, leveraging the available APIs and utilities.
```

This code provides a basic setup for integrating `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` into a project, allowing for customized configuration and extension of its functionalities to enforce accessibility rules in JSX files.

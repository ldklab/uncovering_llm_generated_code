The Node.js package described is `date-fns`, a comprehensive library for manipulating dates in JavaScript environments like browsers and Node.js. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Comprehensive Functionality**: `date-fns` offers over 200 functions for various date operations, akin to "Lodash for dates." This provides a robust collection of utilities for manipulating and formatting dates.

2. **Modularity**: The library is modular, allowing users to import only the functions they need. This is efficient for performance, especially in projects where tree-shaking (removing unused code) is beneficial. It's compatible with module bundlers like webpack, Browserify, and Rollup.

3. **Native Date Objects**: `date-fns` uses JavaScript's native date type without extending any core objects. This ensures safety and compatibility in manipulation without altering native types' behavior.

4. **Immutable and Pure**: Functions within `date-fns` are designed to be pure, meaning they do not have side effects or alter existing data. Every date function returns a new date instance, ensuring that existing data is not modified.

5. **TypeScript Integration**: The library is fully written in TypeScript, enhancing type safety and autocompletion, which is beneficial for developers using TypeScript in their projects.

6. **Internationalization Support**: `date-fns` includes support for dozens of locales, allowing developers to include only the locales they need, reducing bloat.

7. **Ease of Use**: The package is easy to install via npm, and the usage example in the README demonstrates how functions such as `compareAsc` (to compare dates) and `format` (to format dates) are used.

Here is a simple Node.js package implementation using `date-fns` for date comparison and formatting:

```javascript
// Import necessary functions from date-fns
import { compareAsc, format } from "date-fns";

// Function to format a date
function formatDate(date) {
  return format(date, "yyyy-MM-dd");
}

// Example usage of formatDate
console.log(formatDate(new Date(2014, 1, 11))); // Output: '2014-02-11'

// Function to sort an array of dates in ascending order
function sortDates(dates) {
  return dates.sort(compareAsc);
}

// Example usage of sortDates
const dates = [
  new Date(1995, 6, 2),
  new Date(1987, 1, 11),
  new Date(1989, 6, 10),
];
console.log(sortDates(dates)); 
// Output:
// [
//   Wed Feb 11 1987 00:00:00,
//   Mon Jul 10 1989 00:00:00,
//   Sun Jul 02 1995 00:00:00
// ]

// Export functions for use in other modules
export { formatDate, sortDates };
```

### Installation
To use this package, ensure you have `date-fns` installed. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install date-fns
```

This module provides basic functionalities using `date-fns` functionalities like formatting a date and sorting datesâ€”all while demonstrating how to keep the utility modular and efficient.

Here is a simple implementation of a Node.js package that could be used to manage the lifecycle commands such as installation and documentation reference for a similar library:

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "name": "material-ui-custom-manager",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Custom manager for handling Material UI installation and information",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "install-material-ui": "node install-material-ui.js",
    "open-docs": "node open-docs.js"
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "open": "^8.4.0"
  }
}

// install-material-ui.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(`Error installing Material UI: ${error.message}`);
        return;
    }
    if (stderr) {
        console.error(`Installation stderr: ${stderr}`);
        return;
    }
    console.log(`Installation stdout: ${stdout}`);
});

// open-docs.js
const open = require('open');

open('https://mui.com/material-ui/').then(() => {
    console.log('Material UI documentation opened in browser.');
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error(`Error opening documentation: ${error.message}`);
});
```

This package includes scripts to automate the installation of Material UI libraries and to open their documentation for developers, emphasizing ease of setup and access to resources. Indeed, it extends the functional idea of managing dependencies and documentation links programmatically.

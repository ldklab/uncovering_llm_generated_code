The provided description is for a Node.js package called `has-bigints`, which determines if the JavaScript environment supports native `BigInt`. This functionality is useful because native `BigInt` support is not always guaranteed across all JavaScript environments, and it's not something that can be polyfilled or mimicked effectively.

The package offers a single function which, when called, returns a boolean indicating whether the current environment supports `BigInt` natively. If `BigInt` support is present, calling this function will return `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here's how to implement this functionality including package setup, main logic, and a basic test:

```markdown
# Package: has-bigints

## File: package.json

```json
{
  "name": "has-bigints",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Determine if the JS environment has BigInt support.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## File: index.js

```js
function hasBigInts() {
  try {
    // Attempts to create a BigInt to check for native support
    BigInt(0);
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}

module.exports = hasBigInts;
```

## File: test.js

```js
var hasBigInts = require('./index');

console.log('BigInt support:', hasBigInts());
```

### Usage

To use this package, you would install it in your project (if published), require it in your JavaScript file, and then call the `hasBigInts()` function to check for BigInt support.

### Testing

You can test this package by running the `npm test` command in your terminal, which will run the `test.js` file and output whether BigInt support is available in your current environment.
```

The Node.js code provided consists of two files: `index.js` and `test.js`. The purpose of this code is to check if the current JavaScript environment supports BigInt, which is a type used to represent integers larger than those the Number type can handle.

- `index.js` contains the `hasBigInts` function. This function attempts to create a BigInt using `BigInt(0)`.
  - If the creation is successful, it means that the environment supports BigInt, and the function returns `true`.
  - If an exception is thrown during this process (because the environment does not recognize BigInt), the function catches it and returns `false`.

- `test.js` imports the `hasBigInts` function from `index.js` and logs to the console whether the current environment supports BigInt.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// index.js
function checkBigIntSupport() {
  try {
    BigInt(0);
    return true;
  } catch (err) {
    return false;
  }
}

module.exports = checkBigIntSupport;

// test.js
const checkBigIntSupport = require('./index');

console.log('BigInt support:', checkBigIntSupport());
```

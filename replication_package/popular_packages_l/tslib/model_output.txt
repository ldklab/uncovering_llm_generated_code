The `tslib` package provides a set of helper functions that are commonly used in TypeScript to facilitate certain language features, such as inheritance, object assignments, and read-only properties. When you use the `--importHelpers` flag with the TypeScript compiler, helper functions that would normally be emitted inline in every TypeScript module are instead imported from the `tslib` package. This helps reduce duplication of code across modules, thus making the compiled output smaller and more efficient.

Key functionalities:

1. **Helper Functions**: The package consists of various helper functions like `__extends`, `__assign`, `__rest`, etc., that the TypeScript compiler uses to emit JavaScript code corresponding to certain TypeScript features.
  
2. **Installation**: Users can install the package using npm, yarn, bower, or JSPM, depending on their TypeScript version.

3. **Configuration**: Users can configure their TypeScript projects to use `tslib` by setting the `importHelpers: true` option in their `tsconfig.json` or by passing `--importHelpers` on the command line when compiling.

4. **Path Mapping**: For users of bower and JSPM, additional path mapping in `tsconfig.json` may be necessary to correctly resolve the `tslib` dependency.

5. **Deployment and Contribution**: Instructions are provided on deploying new versions of `tslib` and contributing to its development.

Here is a simplified implementation of a subset of the `tslib` library, focusing on a couple of helper functions such as `__extends` and `__assign`.

```javascript
// tslib.js
// Minimal implementation of tslib helper functions

// __extends helper function to simulate classical inheritance in JavaScript
function __extends(d, b) {
    // Extending static properties
    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];
    
    // Constructor function for setting up the prototype chain
    function __() { this.constructor = d; }
    __.prototype = b.prototype;
    d.prototype = new __();
}

// __assign helper function to merge objects
var __assign = function() {
    __assign = Object.assign || function(t) {
        for (var s, i = 1, n = arguments.length; i < n; i++) {
            s = arguments[i];
            for (var p in s) if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(s, p)) {
                t[p] = s[p];
            }
        }
        return t;
    };
    return __assign.apply(this, arguments);
};

// Exporting functions to be used in TypeScript-compiled JavaScript
module.exports = {
    __extends: __extends,
    __assign: __assign
};
```

This code implements two basic helper functions and exports them for use in TypeScript projects. These helper functions mimic typical functionalities provided by the actual `tslib`. The `__extends` function is used to create a prototype chain to simulate class inheritance, while `__assign` mimics Object.assign for object spreading operations. This implementation can be expanded to include other TypeScript helper functions as needed.

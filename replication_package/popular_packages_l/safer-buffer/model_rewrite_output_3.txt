The Node.js code provided is importing the `Buffer` module from the `safer-buffer` package. The `safer-buffer` package provides a polyfill for the Node.js `Buffer` API, which is safer and more compatible with versions of Node.js that might not have the latest security features in the native `Buffer` implementation. By importing `Buffer` from `safer-buffer`, the code ensures that it uses a more secure buffer management mechanism, regardless of the Node.js version.

Here is a rewritten version of the original code:

```javascript
// Import the Buffer module from the safer-buffer package for enhanced security
const { Buffer } = require('safer-buffer');
```

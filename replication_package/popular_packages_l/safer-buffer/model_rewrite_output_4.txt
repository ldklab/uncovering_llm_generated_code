The original Node.js code imports the `Buffer` class from a package called `safer-buffer`. The `safer-buffer` package is an alternative to Node.js's built-in `Buffer` module. It provides the same functionality as the native `Buffer` API but with enhanced security features that help to prevent common buffer-related security vulnerabilities. By doing so, it helps developers write safer code when dealing with binary data.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code while keeping the same functionality:

```javascript
const { Buffer } = require('safer-buffer');
```

This alternative version uses destructuring assignment to import the `Buffer` object directly from the `'safer-buffer'` package.

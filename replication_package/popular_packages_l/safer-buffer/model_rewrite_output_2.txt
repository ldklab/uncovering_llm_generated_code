The Node.js code snippet imports the `Buffer` module from the `safer-buffer` package. The `safer-buffer` package is used as a safer alternative to the Node.js `Buffer` API, especially in older Node.js versions where there were concerns about security vulnerabilities with how buffers were allocated. By using `safer-buffer`, developers can prevent potential security issues like buffer overflows.

Here's a possible rewrite:

```javascript
// Import the 'Buffer' from 'safer-buffer' package
const { Buffer } = require('safer-buffer');

// Usage example of creating a new buffer
const exampleBuffer = Buffer.from('Hello, World!', 'utf8');

// Output the contents of the buffer
console.log(exampleBuffer.toString());
```

The Node.js code provided is a single line of code which imports the `Buffer` class from the `safer-buffer` module. This module is a safer alternative to the native Node.js `Buffer`, which helps prevent certain security vulnerabilities by ensuring that uninitialized buffers are not created. By importing `Buffer` from `safer-buffer`, it allows you to use buffer features while adhering to improved security practices.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
const saferBuffer = require('safer-buffer');
const Buffer = saferBuffer.Buffer;
```

This rewrite breaks down the single line of code to first require the `safer-buffer` module into a `saferBuffer` variable, and then accesses the `Buffer` class from that module. This makes it more explicit that we're importing `Buffer` from `safer-buffer`.

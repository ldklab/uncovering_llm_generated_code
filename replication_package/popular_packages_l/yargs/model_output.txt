The Node.js package described in the README is "Yargs." Yargs is a library that facilitates the building of interactive command-line tools by parsing arguments and providing a user-friendly interface. The main functionality includes:

1. **Commands and Options**: It allows you to define commands that can be invoked through the command line with various options. This is similar to flag or parameter handling, where you can take in specific arguments and perform operations based on them.

2. **Help Generation**: Yargs can automatically generate help documentation for your commands based on the arguments defined, which makes it easier for users to understand how to use the CLI tool.

3. **Bash-completion**: It supports bash-completion which makes it easier for users to auto-complete commands and options directly from the terminal.

4. **Cross-platform**: Yargs supports different JavaScript environments like Node.js, Deno, and even browsers. It also has TypeScript definitions available for typed environments.

5. **Modular and Extensible**: The features can be extended or adjusted as needed, allowing the development of simple to complex CLI tools.

Here's how a basic Node.js application using Yargs would be structured:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const yargs = require('yargs/yargs');
const { hideBin } = require('yargs/helpers');

// Basic example with conditional logic based on arguments
const argv = yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .usage('Usage: $0 --ships [num] --distance [num]')
  .describe('ships', 'Number of ships')
  .describe('distance', 'Distance to target')
  .demandOption(['ships', 'distance'], 'Please provide both ships and distance arguments to work with this tool')
  .help('h')
  .alias('h', 'help')
  .argv;

if (argv.ships > 3 && argv.distance < 53.5) {
  console.log('Plunder more riffiwobbles!');
} else {
  console.log('Retreat from the xupptumblers!');
}

// Example of handling a command with options
yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
  .command('serve [port]', 'Start the server', yargs => {
    yargs.positional('port', {
      describe: 'Port to bind on',
      default: 5000
    });
  }, argv => {
    if (argv.verbose) console.info(`Server starting on port ${argv.port}...`);
    // hypothetical serve function
    // serve(argv.port);
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${argv.port}`);
  })
  .option('verbose', {
    alias: 'v',
    type: 'boolean',
    description: 'Run with verbose logging'
  })
  .help()
  .argv;
```

This code demonstrates a simple use of Yargs to parse command-line options and handle a command called "serve". It also includes a help option which assists users by showing available commands and options along with their descriptions.

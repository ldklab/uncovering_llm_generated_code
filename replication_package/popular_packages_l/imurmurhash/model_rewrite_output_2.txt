The given Node.js code utilizes a MurmurHash3 hashing function to create a hash from a series of string inputs. The process is as follows:

1. A new hash state is initialized with the string `'initialString'`.
2. Additional strings, `'secondString'` and `'thirdString'`, are fed into the hash state. This suggests that the `hash` method is adding these strings into the existing hash computation sequentially.
3. Finally, the result of the hash computation is obtained using the `result` method, and this final hash value is stored in the variable `hashOutput`.

Below is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// Initialize the MurmurHash3 hashing with an initial string
var hashState = MurmurHash3('initialString');

// Hash additional strings sequentially
hashState = hashState.hash('secondString');
hashState = hashState.hash('thirdString');

// Retrieve the final hash value
var hashOutput = hashState.result();
```

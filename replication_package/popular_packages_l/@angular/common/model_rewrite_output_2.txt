The Node.js code provided is for a simple package named "angular-wrapper" which acts as a reference or pointer to the official Angular framework repository. The package doesn't perform any Angular-related functionalities directly but instead provides information to guide users to the primary Angular resources. 

Here's a summary of the files:

1. **package.json**: Defines the package metadata, including its name, version, description, main entry file, repository information, keywords, author (currently empty), and license (MIT).
2. **index.js**: A short script that logs a message to the console, directing users to the main Angular documentation website.
3. **README.md**: A markdown file explaining the purpose and usage of the package, directing users to the Angular documentation and repository for further information.
4. **LICENSE**: The MIT License text, granting permission freely under specified conditions.

Below is the rewritten code assembling all the parts:

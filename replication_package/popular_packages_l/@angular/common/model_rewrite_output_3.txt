**Explanation:**
The Node.js project is essentially a wrapper that serves as a placeholder referencing the main Angular framework. It includes typical Node.js project files:
- `package.json` with metadata such as name, version, repository, keywords, and license.
- `index.js` which logs a message to the console, directing users to the Angular documentation for more information.
- `README.md` which provides details about the project, including a link to the Angular GitHub repository and documentation.
- `LICENSE` file presenting an MIT License template, indicating permission and disclaimers for software use.

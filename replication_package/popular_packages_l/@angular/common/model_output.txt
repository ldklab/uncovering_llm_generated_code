The Node.js package README.md file suggests that this package acts as a wrapper or a reference to the main Angular framework. It indicates that the sources for this package can be found in the main Angular repository on GitHub. Users are instructed to file issues and pull requests to that repository. It also provides links to Angular documentation for more detailed usage information and reference details. The package is licensed under MIT, which is an open-source license allowing for reuse within proprietary software provided all copies include the original license and notice of any changes.

Since this README does not describe any specific functionality aside from pointing to the Angular main repository and documentation, "implementing" the functionality essentially means creating a package that references those resources. Below is an implementation of the Node.js package with the described functionality based on the explanation:

```markdown
// package.json

  },
  "keywords": [

    "frontend",
    "framework",
    "reference"
  ],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT"
}

// index.js
console.log("This package is a reference to the main Angular framework. Please visit https://angular.io/docs for more information.");

// README.md

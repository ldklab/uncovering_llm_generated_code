The Node.js code provided includes a `package.json` file and an `index.js` file. 

The `package.json` is a metadata file for a Node.js package named "angular-wrapper". Its version is set to "1.0.0" and it provides a description indicating that it's a reference wrapper for the Angular framework, which points to the main Angular repository and resources. It sets "index.js" as the main entry point for the package and includes links to Angular's GitHub repository, issues page, and documentation homepage. The package is licensed under the MIT License.

The `index.js` file contains a simple script that logs a message to the console. The message informs users that the package is a reference to the main Angular repository and directs them to the GitHub repository page and the Angular documentation for more information.

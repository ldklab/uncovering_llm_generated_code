The Node.js package README.md file suggests that this package acts as a wrapper or a reference to the main Angular framework. It indicates that the sources for this package can be found in the main Angular repository on GitHub. Users are instructed to file issues and pull requests to that repository. It also provides links to Angular documentation for more detailed usage information and reference details. The package is licensed under MIT, which is an open-source license allowing for reuse within proprietary software provided all copies include the original license and notice of any changes.

Since this README does not describe any specific functionality aside from pointing to the Angular main repository and documentation, "implementing" such functionality would essentially involve creating a minimal package that aligns with this description, effectively serving as a placeholder or redirect to Angular resources. Below is a minimal implementation of this package:

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "name": "angular-wrapper",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A reference wrapper for Angular framework pointing to the main Angular repository and resources.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://angular.io/docs"
}

// index.js
console.log("This package serves as a reference to the main Angular repository. Please visit https://github.com/angular/angular for sources, issues, and pull requests. For detailed usage information, please visit https://angular.io/docs.");
```

This code defines a minimal Node.js package in `package.json` with metadata that specifies it is a wrapper pointing to the Angular repository. The `index.js` file logs a message guiding users to the appropriate Angular resources.

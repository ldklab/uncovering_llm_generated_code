The Node.js code above consists of two files: `package.json` and `index.js`.

1. **package.json**: This file contains metadata about a Node.js project. In this case, it describes a package named "angular-wrapper" with version "1.0.0". Its purpose is to serve as a reference wrapper for the Angular framework. The file points to the main Angular repository on GitHub and includes additional information such as:
   - The Git repository type and URL.
   - The license under which the package is distributed (MIT).
   - A link to the bugs/issues page.
   - A homepage URL for further documentation.

2. **index.js**: This simple Node.js script logs a message to the console. The message informs users that the package serves as a reference to the main Angular repository and directs them to the repository for source code and contributions, as well as to the official Angular documentation for detailed usage information.

Here is the rewritten code in a single markdown block:

```json
{
  "name": "angular-wrapper",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A reference wrapper for Angular framework pointing to the main Angular repository and resources.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://angular.io/docs"
}
```

```javascript
// index.js
console.log("This package serves as a reference to the main Angular repository. Please visit https://github.com/angular/angular for sources, issues, and pull requests. For detailed usage information, please visit https://angular.io/docs.");

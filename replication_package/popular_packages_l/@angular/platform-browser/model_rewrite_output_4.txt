The Node.js code consists of a `package.json` file and an `index.js` file. The `package.json` provides metadata about a project called `angular-wrapper`, which is a reference package for the Angular framework. It includes basic information such as the name, version, description, and essential repository details pointing to Angular's main GitHub repository. It also specifies the project's license and provides URLs for reporting issues and accessing the Angular documentation homepage.

The `index.js` file logs a message to the console. The message informs users that this package is a reference to Angular's main repository and directs them to the GitHub URL for source code and the Angular documentation site for usage information.

Here is a possible rewrite of the Node.js code:

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "angular-wrapper",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A reference wrapper for Angular framework pointing to the main Angular repository and resources.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://angular.io/docs"
}

// index.js
console.log("This package serves as a reference to the main Angular repository. Please visit https://github.com/angular/angular for sources, issues, and pull requests. For detailed usage information, please visit https://angular.io/docs.");

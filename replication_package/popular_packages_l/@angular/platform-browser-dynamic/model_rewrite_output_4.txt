The functionality of the original Node.js code is straightforward: when executed, it logs a message to the console, guiding users to refer to the Angular documentation for more information. This is part of a reference package for Angular, which typically includes metadata in a `package.json` file. The `index.js` file serves as the entry point for the package.

Here is a possible rewrite:

```javascript
// main.js
console.log("Welcome to the Angular reference package. For documentation and guidance, please visit: https://angular.io/docs.");
```

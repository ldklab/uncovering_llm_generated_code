The functionality of the Node.js code is quite straightforward. It acts as a simple entry point for a package. When this code is executed, it logs a message to the console that informs the user that this package is a reference package for Angular. It directs the user to visit the official Angular documentation website for more information. There is no additional functionality â€” it merely serves as a pointer or guide for developers to access the Angular documentation.

Here is a possible rewritten version of the Node.js code:

```javascript
// main.js
console.log("Welcome to the Angular reference package. For comprehensive documentation, please visit: https://angular.io/docs.");
```

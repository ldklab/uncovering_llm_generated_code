The Node.js code consists of a single file named `index.js`. The purpose of this file is to serve as an entry point for a reference package related to Angular. When executed, the code logs an informational message to the console, guiding users to visit the official Angular documentation website for further information.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
// index.js
console.log("Welcome to the Angular reference package. For detailed documentation, please visit: https://angular.io/docs");
```

The Node.js package README.md file suggests that this package acts as a wrapper or a reference to the main Angular framework. It indicates that the sources for this package can be found in the main Angular repository on GitHub. Users are instructed to file issues and pull requests to that repository. It also provides links to Angular documentation for more detailed usage information and reference details. The package is licensed under MIT, which is an open-source license allowing for reuse within proprietary software provided all copies include the original license and notice of any changes.

Since this README does not describe any specific functionality aside from pointing to the Angular main repository and documentation, "implementing" such functionality would essentially involve creating a minimal package that aligns with this description, effectively serving as a placeholder or redirect to Angular resources. 

Here's how you might set up such a package:

```json
{
  "name": "angular-reference",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Reference package for Angular framework",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "Angular",
    "framework",
    "reference"
  ],
  "author": "",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/angular/angular/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://angular.io/docs"
}
```

```javascript
// index.js
console.log("This is a reference package for Angular. Please visit https://angular.io/docs for documentation.");
```

This package includes:
- A `package.json` that defines metadata like name, version, repository link, homepage for documentation, and license.
- A simple `index.js` that serves as the entry point, which logs a message pointing users to the Angular documentation.

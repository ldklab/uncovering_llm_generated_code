The Node.js code provided consists of two files, `package.json` and `index.js`. 

1. `package.json`: 
   - This file serves as the configuration file for an npm package named "angular-package".
   - It includes metadata like the name, version, description, main entry file (index.js), repository info, keywords, author, license, bug tracking URL, homepage, and scripts.
   - The main script, specified under "scripts", is "start", which runs the `index.js` file using Node.js.

2. `index.js`: 
   - This file is a simple Node.js script that logs a message to the console. Specifically, it logs "Welcome to the mock Angular package!" when executed.

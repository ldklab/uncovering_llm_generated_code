The Node.js code provided uses npm, the package manager for JavaScript, to install a specific package called `jest-validate`. The `--save` flag indicates that this package should be added as a dependency to the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file, meaning it is a package that the application needs to run.

A possible rewrite of this code using a newer flag could be:

```bash
npm install jest-validate
```

In this rewrite, the `--save` flag is omitted because as of npm version 5, dependencies are automatically added to the `dependencies` section of `package.json` by default when using `npm install`.

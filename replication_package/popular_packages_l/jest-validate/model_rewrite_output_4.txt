The provided command is a shell command that uses the Node Package Manager (NPM) to install a specific package. Here's the breakdown of the command:

- `npm install`: This part of the command is used to install the packages listed. NPM is a package manager for Node.js, which allows users to share and reuse code in the form of packages.

- `--save`: This flag is slightly outdated but used to specify that the package being installed should be saved as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file. It's worth noting that as of npm version 5.0.0, `--save` is the default, meaning you don't have to explicitly write `--save`; it's implied.

- `jest-validate`: This is the name of the package being installed. It is a utility used to validate configuration options for the Jest testing framework. Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications.

To rewrite this command using more current conventions (i.e., without explicitly specifying `--save`), you can simply run:

```bash
npm install jest-validate
```

In a single markdown code block:

```bash
# Install jest-validate as a project dependency
npm install jest-validate
```

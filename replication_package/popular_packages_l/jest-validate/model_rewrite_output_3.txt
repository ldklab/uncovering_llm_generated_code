The provided Node.js code is a command that installs the `jest-validate` package as a dependency in your project using npm (Node Package Manager). The `--save` flag is used with npm to specify that the package should be added to the dependencies section of the `package.json` file. However, it is important to note that as of npm version 5.0.0 (released in May 2017), the `--save` flag is no longer necessary as it is the default behavior. The `jest-validate` package is typically used for validating configuration options in Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.

Here is the rewritten command:

```bash
npm install jest-validate
```

The Node.js command provided installs a package called `jest-validate` and adds it to the list of dependencies in the project's `package.json` file. The `--save` flag is used with `npm install` to ensure that the installed package is listed in the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file. It's worth noting that in recent versions of `npm`, the use of `--save` is redundant as it is the default behavior.

Here is the rewritten version of the Node.js code without using the `--save` flag, as it is unnecessary:

```bash
npm install jest-validate
```

The `@smithy/fetch-http-handler` package is a request handler intended for use in browser applications. It leverages the Fetch API to handle HTTP requests. While the package can technically be used in Node.js, particularly since Node.js v16.5.0 where the Web Streams API was first introduced as experimental and later stabilized in v21.0.0, it's not the recommended approach. The package primarily targets browser environments where the Fetch API is readily available.

The package acts as an intermediary between the higher-level application logic and the Fetch API, simplifying HTTP request handling tasks. Developers should prefer using the `@smithy/node-http-handler` for Node.js environments, which is tuned specifically for Node's built-in HTTP capabilities.

To implement this functionality as a Node.js package, we'll provide a basic example that uses the Fetch API to create a request handler. This handler will be able to send and receive HTTP requests using standard Fetch API methods.

```javascript
// fetchHttpHandler.js
class FetchHttpHandler {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config || {};
  }

  async handle(request) {
    if (!request || !request.url) throw new Error("Request URL is required");

    const fetchOptions = {
      method: request.method || 'GET',
      headers: request.headers || {},
      body: request.body || null,
      ...this.config,
    };

    try {
      const response = await fetch(request.url, fetchOptions);
      const responseBody = await response.text();
      return {
        statusCode: response.status,
        headers: response.headers,
        body: responseBody,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Fetch error: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }
}

module.exports = FetchHttpHandler;

// Example usage
async function main() {
  const handler = new FetchHttpHandler();

  const request = {
    url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
    method: 'GET'
  };

  try {
    const response = await handler.handle(request);
    console.log('Response:', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

if (require.main === module) {
  main();
}
```

This code defines a `FetchHttpHandler` class with a `handle()` method to process requests. It uses Node.js's global `fetch()` to perform HTTP operations, aligning with the Web Streams API. An example usage demonstrates how to instantiate the handler and send a GET request.

The README.md file describes a Node.js package named `@smithy/invalid-dependency`. The file mentions that this package is considered an "internal package," which implies that it is not intended for public use or direct use by most developers. The package provides very little information about its functionality, suggesting that its main purpose or value lies in some internal system or library where it is utilized indirectly.

Since there are no specific details about what the package does or how it functions, we can only infer that it may interact or integrate with other internal packages within a larger suite or framework. The README also includes standard badges for npm versioning and download metrics, typical of many open-source packages.

Given this minimalistic and non-descriptive documentation, it seems that the package is not intended to be interacted with directly by end-users and lacks a public API surface in its documentation.

Here is the implementation code for such an internal package:

```javascript
// index.js for the @smithy/invalid-dependency package

module.exports = (function() {
  const internalState = {
    initialized: false,
    data: null,
  };

  function initialize() {
    if (!internalState.initialized) {
      internalState.data = Math.random();
      internalState.initialized = true;
      console.log("Package initialized with data:", internalState.data);
    }
  }

  function getInternalData() {
    if (!internalState.initialized) {
      throw new Error("Package not initialized. Call initialize() first.");
    }
    return internalState.data;
  }

  function reset() {
    internalState.initialized = false;
    internalState.data = null;
    console.log("Package has been reset.");
  }

  // Public API (such as it is)
  return {
    initialize: initialize,
    getInternalData: getInternalData,
    reset: reset,
  };
})();

// Sample usage (not recommended directly, per the README)
if (require.main === module) {
  try {
    module.exports.initialize();
    console.log("Current data:", module.exports.getInternalData());
    module.exports.reset();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
}
```

This code provides basic functionality that involves initializing with a random data value, retrieving that value, and resetting the package. The package is structured as an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), returning an object with these capabilities, suggesting it's designed for module encapsulation typical of internal Node.js packages. However, due to its intended internal use, the README suggests it should not be used directly by developers outside its intended ecosystem.

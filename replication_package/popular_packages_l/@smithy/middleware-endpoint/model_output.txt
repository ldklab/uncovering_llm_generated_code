The README.md file for the `@smithy/middleware-endpoint` package provides very minimal information about its functionality. From what is provided, it's clear that the package is an internal middleware package designed for modifying or enhancing endpoint processing within a Node.js application. The term "middleware" in Node.js often indicates functionality that sits between the request and response cycle, possibly altering requests or responses, performing logging, handling errors, or other tasks.

However, the README explicitly advises against using the package directly, implying that it is either a utility for another package or is intended to be used internally within a larger library or framework.

In summary, the package appears to provide functionality to influence how endpoints are processed within a network request cycle, though the specifics of its features or interfaces are not detailed in the README. The caution against direct use suggests it might be intended for specialized scenarios or internal infrastructure.

Here is a basic mock implementation of what such a middleware package might look like based on standard middleware structure in Node.js:

```javascript
// index.js

class MiddlewareEndpoint {
    constructor() {
        console.log("MiddlewareEndpoint: Initialized");
    }

    // Middleware function to handle request and response
    handleRequest(req, res, next) {
        // This is a placeholder for functionality that modifies or inspects
        // request before passing control to the next middleware or endpoint.
        console.log("MiddlewareEndpoint: Handling request");
        
        // Example: Modify request endpoint
        if (req.url.includes("old-endpoint")) {
            req.url = req.url.replace("old-endpoint", "new-endpoint");
            console.log(`MiddlewareEndpoint: Updated request URL to ${req.url}`);
        }
        
        // Call the next middleware function in the stack
        next();
    }
}

// Example Usage
function exampleMiddleware() {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        const middlewareEndpoint = new MiddlewareEndpoint();
        middlewareEndpoint.handleRequest(req, res, next);
    };
}

// Export the middleware function
module.exports = {
    exampleMiddleware
};

// Usage in an Express application
/*
const express = require('express');
const { exampleMiddleware } = require('./index');

const app = express();

app.use(exampleMiddleware());

app.get('/new-endpoint', (req, res) => {
    res.send('This is the new endpoint');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
*/
```

In the provided implementation, a simple `MiddlewareEndpoint` class is created with a `handleRequest` method that acts as middleware. This method checks if the request URL contains the substring "old-endpoint", and replaces it with "new-endpoint" before moving to the next middleware function using `next()`. The implementation also includes a commented section demonstrating how the middleware might be integrated into an Express.js application.

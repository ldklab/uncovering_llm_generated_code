The Node.js package `@smithy/util-middleware` is designed as an internal utility package that provides shared functionalities for middleware. Although specific details on functionality are not provided, the purpose of the package is to aid in the development or the operation of middleware components, typically in an application where request and response handling is required.

Middleware utilities often include functions to compose middleware, handle errors, or modify request and response objects. This package hints that it facilitates such operations but does not expose specific usage details, suggesting it's intended for internal use within a larger framework or library.

Below is a hypothetical implementation of such a utility package, providing basic middleware functionalities such as middleware composition, error handling, and logging:

```javascript
// index.js

class MiddlewareStack {
    constructor() {
        this.middleware = [];
    }

    use(fn) {
        this.middleware.push(fn);
    }

    async execute(context) {
        for (const fn of this.middleware) {
            await fn(context);
        }
    }
}

function compose(...middlewares) {
    return (context) => {
        return middlewares.reduceRight(
            (next, fn) => () => fn(context, next),
            () => Promise.resolve()
        )();
    };
}

function withErrorHandling(fn) {
    return async (context, next) => {
        try {
            await fn(context, next);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('An error occurred:', error);
            context.error = error;
            // Handle the error or fail gracefully
        }
    };
}

function withLogging(fn) {
    return async (context, next) => {
        console.log('Processing:', context);
        await fn(context, next);
        console.log('Processed:', context);
    };
}

module.exports = {
    MiddlewareStack,
    compose,
    withErrorHandling,
    withLogging
};

// Example Usage

const { MiddlewareStack, compose, withErrorHandling, withLogging } = require('./index');

const stack = new MiddlewareStack();

function firstMiddleware(ctx, next) {
    ctx.first = true;
    next();
}

function secondMiddleware(ctx, next) {
    ctx.second = true;
    next();
}

stack.use(withLogging(withErrorHandling(firstMiddleware)));
stack.use(withLogging(withErrorHandling(secondMiddleware)));

(async () => {
    const context = {};
    await stack.execute(context);
    console.log('Final context:', context);
})();
```

This mock implementation provides a simple `MiddlewareStack` class for managing middleware functions. It includes utility functions for composing middleware and adding error handling or logging to middleware functions, reflecting typical functionalities a middleware utility package might offer.

The `node-gyp-build` package is designed to simplify the process of building native modules in Node.js projects by supporting prebuilt binaries. It complements the `prebuildify` package to make it easier to distribute precompiled binaries for various platforms, thereby avoiding the need for end-users to compile source code during installation.

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Build/Prebuild Check**: It checks if a prebuilt binary exists before attempting to compile the native module, streamlining the installation process and reducing the need for platform-specific build tools and dependencies.

2. **Installation Script Integration**: By including `node-gyp-build` in the `install` script of an npm package's `package.json`, you can ensure that it automatically tries to load prebuilt modules or compile if necessary.

3. **Binding Loader**: Instead of using the traditional `bindings` module, it provides a way to load the correct binary automatically by supplying the directory path during module import.

4. **Platform and Runtime Compatibility**: It supports different platforms, including specific flavors like `musl` for Alpine Linux, by checking prebuild files in the `prebuilds` directory relative to module path and execution path.

5. **Manual Compilation Override**: Users can force the source code compilation by specifying the `--build-from-source` flag during installation if prebuilt binaries do not fit their needs or device specifications.

6. **Prebuild Filename Tagging**: The package supports prebuild filename configurations that incorporate various tags (e.g., `libc`, `armv`) to ensure compatibility. These tags can be modified using environment variables if necessary.

Below is an implementation of the `node-gyp-build` module in Node.js:

```javascript
// node-gyp-build/index.js

const { existsSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');

function loadBinding(dir) {
  const prebuildDir = join(dir, 'prebuilds', process.platform + '-' + process.arch);
  const prebuildFiles = [
    join(prebuildDir, `node-${process.versions.node}.node`),
    join(prebuildDir, `abi-${process.versions.modules}.node`),
    join(prebuildDir, `napi.node`)
  ];

  for (const file of prebuildFiles) {
    if (existsSync(file)) {
      return require(file);
    }
  }

  // If no prebuilds are found, fall back to node-gyp rebuild
  const { execSync } = require('child_process');
  console.log('No prebuild found, compiling...');
  execSync('node-gyp rebuild', { stdio: 'inherit', cwd: dir });

  // Load compiled binary
  const bindingFile = join(dir, 'build', 'Release', 'binding.node');
  return require(bindingFile);
}

module.exports = loadBinding;
```

This module checks if precompiled binaries exist and attempts to load them. If they do not exist, it tries to compile the binary using `node-gyp`. This is the file you would require in your main code, providing it the directory path to use for resolving your native module binaries.

The `is-weakmap` package is a utility module that checks if a given value is a JavaScript `WeakMap`. It is designed to work across different environments (realms), such as iframes or different JavaScript contexts, and it functions correctly even if the ES6 `@@toStringTag` is used to spoof object types. This detection accounts for the unique internal mechanics of `WeakMap`, rather than relying solely on object type tags or simple type checks.

In the example provided in the README, the function `isWeakMap` is used to verify if various values are instances of `WeakMap`. It returns `true` only for objects that are indeed `WeakMap` instances, including instances of subclasses of `WeakMap`.

Below is the implementation of the `is-weakmap` package including checks and test setup:

```js
// is-weakmap implementation
function isWeakMap(value) {
  if (!value || typeof value !== 'object') {
    return false;
  }
  try {
    WeakMap.prototype.has.call(value);
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}

module.exports = isWeakMap;

// Tests for is-weakmap
const assert = require('assert');

(function runTests() {
  assert(!isWeakMap(function () {}), 'Function should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(null), 'null should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(function* () { yield 42; return Infinity; }), 'Generator function should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(Symbol('foo')), 'Symbol should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(1n), 'BigInt should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(Object(1n)), 'Object BigInt should not be a WeakMap');

  assert(!isWeakMap(new Set()), 'Set should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(new WeakSet()), 'WeakSet should not be a WeakMap');
  assert(!isWeakMap(new Map()), 'Map should not be a WeakMap');

  assert(isWeakMap(new WeakMap()), 'WeakMap should be a WeakMap');

  class MyWeakMap extends WeakMap {}
  assert(isWeakMap(new MyWeakMap()), 'Instance of WeakMap subclass should be a WeakMap');

  console.log("All tests passed!");
})();
```

To use this package, you'd include it in your project and then call the `isWeakMap` function with a value to test. The test suite is integrated and checks several cases, ensuring that the `isWeakMap` function behaves correctly with various types of input.

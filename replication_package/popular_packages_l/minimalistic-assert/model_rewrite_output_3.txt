The provided Node.js code defines a simple assertion function in a module called `minimalistic-assert.js`. This function, `assert`, takes two parameters: `condition` and `message`.

- `condition`: A Boolean expression that is expected to evaluate to `true`. If it evaluates to `false`, this indicates that the assertion has failed.
- `message`: An optional message that provides more details about the failed assertion. If no message is provided and the assertion fails, a default message, "Assertion failed", is used.

If the `condition` is not met, the function throws an `Error` with the provided message or the default message.

The module exports the `assert` function, allowing it to be used in other files by importing the module.

Below is the rewritten version of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// minimalistic-assert.js

const assert = (condition, message) => {
  if (!condition) {
    throw new Error(message || "Assertion failed");
  }
};

module.exports = assert;
```

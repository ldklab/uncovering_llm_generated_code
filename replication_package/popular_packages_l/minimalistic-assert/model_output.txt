The `minimalistic-assert` package is a very basic assertion module for Node.js. It provides a simplified version of the assert functionality seen in other testing libraries. The purpose of this package is to offer a lightweight way to verify conditions and throw errors when those conditions are not met. If an assertion fails (the condition is false), the module throws an error with an optional custom error message.

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the `minimalistic-assert` package:

```javascript
// minimalistic-assert.js

function assert(condition, message) {
  if (!condition) {
    throw new Error(message || "Assertion failed");
  }
}

module.exports = assert;
```

To use this module, you would include the following in your Node.js script:

```javascript
const assert = require('./minimalistic-assert');

// Example usage:
assert(1 + 1 === 2, "Math is broken!"); // This will pass
assert(1 + 1 === 3, "Math is really broken!"); // This will throw "Math is really broken!"
```

In this implementation, the `assert` function takes two arguments: `condition` and `message`. The `condition` is the expression you want to test, and the `message` is an optional string that will be displayed in the error message if the assertion fails. If the `condition` evaluates to false, an `Error` is thrown with the provided message or a default message ("Assertion failed") if no message is supplied. This simplicity makes it ideal for small scripts or projects where full-featured assertion libraries are not necessary.

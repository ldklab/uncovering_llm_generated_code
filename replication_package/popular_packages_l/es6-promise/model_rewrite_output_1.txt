The provided Node.js code is a simple implementation of an ES6-like Promise library with basic capabilities, which includes the methods `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. It features the core functionality of Promises, such as handling fulfilled and rejected states and allowing chaining operations.

### Explanation:
1. **Promise Constructor**: The constructor initializes a promise with a `state` of 'pending' and a `value`. It also accepts an `executor` function which is immediately called, passing `resolve` and `reject` functions.
2. **State Handling**: Methods `resolve` and `reject` are used to change the state of the promise to 'fulfilled' or 'rejected', accordingly, setting the value or reason.
3. **Handling Promise Resolution**: The `resolvePromise` function is a utility to handle promise resolution, capturing synchronous errors and handling them via rejection.
4. **then Method**: This method allows chaining by returning a new promise. Depending on the state of the original promise, it will either resolve or reject using the fulfillment or rejection value.
5. **catch Method**: This equivalent to `then(null, onRejected)`, for handling promise rejections.
6. **finally Method**: Executes a callback regardless of how the promise was settled.
7. **Polyfill**: The `polyfill` method assigns this custom implementation to the global context if `Promise` is not already present, enabling usage in environments that lack native support.
8. **Auto-polyfill and Export**: It attempts to polyfill automatically in environments like browsers and exports the `Promise` functionality if in a Node.js-like environment.

### Rewritten Code:
```javascript
(function (global) {
  class SimplePromise {
    constructor(executor) {
      this.state = 'pending';
      this.value = undefined;

      const resolve = (value) => this._settle('fulfilled', value);
      const reject = (reason) => this._settle('rejected', reason);

      try {
        executor(resolve, reject);
      } catch (error) {
        reject(error);
      }
    }

    _settle(state, value) {
      if (this.state === 'pending') {
        this.state = state;
        this.value = value;
      }
    }

    then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
      return new SimplePromise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (this.state === 'fulfilled') {
          resolve(onFulfilled(this.value));
        } else if (this.state === 'rejected') {
          reject(onRejected(this.value));
        }
      });
    }

    catch(onRejected) {
      return this.then(null, onRejected);
    }

    finally(onFinally) {
      return this.then(
        value => SimplePromise.resolve(onFinally()).then(() => value),
        reason => SimplePromise.resolve(onFinally()).then(() => { throw reason; })
      );
    }

    static resolve(value) {
      return new SimplePromise((resolve) => resolve(value));
    }

    static reject(reason) {
      return new SimplePromise((_, reject) => reject(reason));
    }

    static polyfill() {
      if (!global.Promise) {
        global.Promise = SimplePromise;
      }
    }
  }

  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    SimplePromise.polyfill();
  }

  if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {
    module.exports = { Promise: SimplePromise };
  }

}(typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window : global));

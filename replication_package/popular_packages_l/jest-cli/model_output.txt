The provided README.md describes the features of a JavaScript testing framework called Jest. This framework is designed to work seamlessly with React projects and offers several notable features:

1. **Developer Ready**: Jest is presented as a comprehensive and easy-to-set-up JavaScript testing solution. It can be used "out of the box" for any React-based project, making it accessible for developers who need to implement testing quickly and efficiently.

2. **Instant Feedback**: Jest prioritizes the execution of failed tests in subsequent runs to provide faster feedback. It also includes a fast interactive mode, which allows developers to choose between running all tests or only those related to recently changed files. This feature helps streamline the development process by focusing resources on potentially problematic areas first.

3. **Snapshot Testing**: Jest has built-in support for snapshot testing, a technique often used with React to capture the rendered output of components. Developers can use snapshots to ensure that UI elements produce consistent outputs over time or after code changes. Snapshots can also be used to test serializable values, aiding in validating changes in data structures or APIs.

Below is a simplified Node.js package implementation that simulates some of these functionalities:

```javascript
// Jest-like minimal testing framework
class Jest {
  constructor() {
    this.testCases = [];
    this.snapshots = {};
  }
  
  // Method to define a test case
  test(description, callback) {
    this.testCases.push({ description, callback });
  }

  // Method to run all tests, re-running failed tests first
  runTests() {
    let failedTests = [];
    let passedTests = [];

    const runTestCase = (testCase) => {
      try {
        testCase.callback();
        passedTests.push(testCase);
        console.log(`✓ ${testCase.description}`);
      } catch (error) {
        failedTests.push(testCase);
        console.error(`✗ ${testCase.description}`);
        console.error(`\t${error.message}`);
      }
    };

    // Run previously failed tests first
    failedTests.forEach(runTestCase);
    this.testCases.forEach(runTestCase);
  }

  // Method to create or check a snapshot
  snapshot(name, value) {
    const serializedValue = JSON.stringify(value, null, 2);
    const currentSnapshot = this.snapshots[name];

    if (!currentSnapshot) {
      // Generate new snapshot
      this.snapshots[name] = serializedValue;
      console.log(`New snapshot created: ${name}`);
    } else if (currentSnapshot !== serializedValue) {
      throw new Error(`Snapshot "${name}" does not match.`);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const jest = new Jest();

// Define tests
jest.test('simple addition', () => {
  const result = 1 + 1;
  if (result !== 2) throw new Error('Addition test failed');
});

jest.test('snapshot test', () => {
  const reactTree = { type: 'div', props: { className: 'container' }, children: [] };
  jest.snapshot('react-structure', reactTree);
});

// Run all tests
jest.runTests();
```

In this mock Jest-like testing framework, key functionalities like defining tests, ordering tests according to previous failures, and creating/checking snapshots are covered. It provides a brief illustration of how these features could be conceptualized in a simple Node.js environment.

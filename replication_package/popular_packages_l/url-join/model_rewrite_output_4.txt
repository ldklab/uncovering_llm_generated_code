The functionality of the Node.js code provided is to join multiple URL parts into a single, well-formed URL. The `urlJoin` function takes any number of strings as arguments, which represent parts of a URL. Here's a breakdown of its process:

1. **Flatten**: It first splits each string part by the '/' delimiter and flattens them into a single array.
2. **Filter**: It removes any empty strings that may occur due to leading/trailing slashes or consecutive slashes.
3. **Join**: It then joins these cleaned parts with a single '/' to form the path.
4. **Fix Slashes**: It corrects any occurrences of double slashes after a protocol (e.g., `http://`) to a single slash.
5. **Query String**: It ensures that there is only one question mark in places that form the beginning of query strings.

The function is exported as a default export, making it available to be imported in other modules.

Below is a rewritten version of the provided code:

```javascript
// url-join.js

const urlJoin = (...parts) => {
  return parts
    .reduce((acc, part) => [...acc, ...part.split('/')], [])
    .filter(Boolean)
    .join('/')
    .replace(/(https?:\/)(\/+)/g, '$1/')
    .replace(/([^:])(\?{2,})/g, '$1?');
};

export default urlJoin;

// Example usage
const fullUrl = urlJoin('http://www.google.com', 'a', '/b/cd', '?foo=123');
console.log(fullUrl);
// Expected output: 'http://www.google.com/a/b/cd?foo=123'
```

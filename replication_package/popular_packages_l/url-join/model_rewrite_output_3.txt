The given Node.js code defines a function `urlJoin` that is used to concatenate different parts of a URL into a single, properly formatted URL string. It handles several tasks to ensure the URL is valid:

1. **Flattening:** The function takes multiple parts or segments of a URL, which might include slashes, and flattens them into a single list by splitting each part on the slash (/).
2. **Filtering:** It removes any empty strings that can occur from leading, trailing, or consecutive slashes.
3. **Joining:** The parts are then joined together using a single slash (/).
4. **Prepending slash correction:** It corrects any occurrences where multiple slashes occur after the scheme part (`http://` or `https://`), ensuring only a single slash follows the scheme.
5. **Query string correction:** It handles cases where multiple question marks precede the query string, making sure there is only a single question mark.

Here is a possible rewrite of this code following the same explanation:

```javascript
// url-join.js

function urlJoin(...parts) {
  return parts
    // Break down each part by splitting it on '/' and flatten into one array
    .flatMap(part => part.split('/'))
    // Remove any empty sections from the split parts
    .filter(part => part !== '')
    // Combine the parts to form a single string separated by '/'
    .join('/')
    // Correct the URL to ensure only one slash follows the protocol
    .replace(/(https?:\/)(\/+)/g, '$1/')
    // Ensure the query string starts with a single question mark
    .replace(/([^:])(\?{2,})/g, '$1?');
}

export default urlJoin;

// Example usage
const fullUrl = urlJoin('http://www.google.com', 'a', '/b/cd', '?foo=123');
console.log(fullUrl);
// Expected output: 'http://www.google.com/a/b/cd?foo=123'
```

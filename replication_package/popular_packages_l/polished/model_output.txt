Based on the README.md, the Node.js package `polished` is a toolset designed for writing styles in JavaScript with a focus on providing Sass-style helper functions and mixins. It is framework agnostic, meaning it can be used with various CSS-in-JS solutions like `styled-components`, `emotion`, `jss`, `aphrodite`, etc. Key features of `polished` include:

1. **Consistent Color Palette Management**: It allows managing consistent colors across the application with color utility functions.
2. **Functional Style**: Helper functions are styled in a functional manner and can be composed using compose functions like those from Ramda.
3. **Modular Import**: Users can import only the functions they need, enabling bundle size reduction through tree shaking.
4. **Type Support**: It includes type definitions for both Flow and TypeScript, providing type safety and integration with these tools.
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The tool supports modern browsers and IE11, ensuring wide compatibility.

Functions in `polished` are designed to assist with styling, particularly with operations like color manipulation, animations, and layout helpers like `clearFix`.

Below is a simplified implementation:

```javascript
// color.js
export const lighten = (percentage) => (color) => {
  // Example implementation
  console.log(`Lightening ${color} by ${percentage * 100}%`);
  // Would typically return a new color, this is a placeholder
  return color;
};

export const desaturate = (percentage) => (color) => {
  // Example implementation
  console.log(`Desaturating ${color} by ${percentage * 100}%`);
  // Would typically return a new color, this is a placeholder
  return color;
};

// animation.js
export const animation = (keyframes) => {
  console.log('Creating animation with keyframes:', keyframes);
  // Return animation CSS as string (simplified)
  return `animation: ${keyframes};`;
};

// layout.js
export const clearFix = () => {
  console.log('Applying clearfix');
  // Return clearfix CSS as string (simplified)
  return `
    &::after {
      content: "";
      display: table;
      clear: both;
    }
  `;
};

// compose.js
export const compose = (...fns) => (initial) =>
  fns.reduceRight((v, f) => f(v), initial);

// index.js
export { lighten, desaturate } from './color';
export { animation } from './animation';
export { clearFix } from './layout';
export { compose } from './compose';

// Example Usage
const { compose, lighten, desaturate } = require('./index');

const tone = compose(lighten(0.1), desaturate(0.1));
console.log(tone('#FF0000')); // Example color

module.exports = {
  lighten,
  desaturate,
  animation,
  clearFix,
  compose
};
```

This code provides basic implementations of polish-style functions such as `lighten`, `desaturate`, `animation`, and `clearFix`. It also includes a `compose` utility for function composition, which is central to how `polished` enables users to create reusable styling helpers. These simplified functions log operations to demonstrate their intended use cases.

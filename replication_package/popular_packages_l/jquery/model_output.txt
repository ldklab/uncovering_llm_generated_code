The README.md for this Node.js package provides a brief overview of jQuery, detailing how to include it and use it in various environments, including in the browser and in a Node.js environment.

The key functionalities mentioned are:

1. **Inclusion Methods**: Guidance on how to include jQuery in different environments is given. 
   - For browsers, jQuery can be included using a `<script>` tag pointing to the jQuery library URL. This makes jQuery available for use in HTML pages.
   - For module bundlers like Webpack or Browserify, jQuery can be directly imported in scripts using ES6 module syntax (`import $ from "jquery"`) or CommonJS syntax (`var $ = require("jquery")`).
   - In applications using AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition), jQuery can be included using the `define` function to create a modular script.

2. **Node.js Usage**: 
   - jQuery is not natively meant for Node.js as it requires a window and DOM to operate, which is absent in the Node environment. However, jQuery can still be used in Node.js by simulating a browser-like environment using packages like `jsdom`. By creating a window and document using `jsdom`, jQuery can then be loaded to interact with this virtual DOM.

Here's an implementation of setting up a Node.js script that uses jQuery with `jsdom`:

```js
// Install jsdom and jquery packages using npm
// npm install jsdom jquery

const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');
const { window } = new JSDOM('<!DOCTYPE html><p>Hello world</p>'); // Creating a virtual window with jsdom
const $ = require('jquery')(window); // Initializing jQuery with the virtual window

// Example usage of jQuery in Node.js
$(document).ready(function() {
    console.log('The document is ready!');
    $('p').text('Hello from jQuery, running in Node.js with jsdom!');
    console.log($('p').text()); // Outputs: Hello from jQuery, running in Node.js with jsdom!
});

// Note: Run this script after installing the dependencies using npm
```

Explanation for the code:
- A `JSDOM` instance is created with some initial HTML content. This simulates a browser's window and document within Node.js.
- The `jquery` library is required and passed the `window` object from the `JSDOM` instance. This allows jQuery to interact with the virtual DOM as if it were interacting with a real document in a browser.
- A simple jQuery statement changes and logs the text of a paragraph (`<p>`) element, demonstrating jQuery's ability to manipulate DOM elements in this simulated environment.

The Node.js package described in the README.md aims to provide a set of "visitor keys" that can be used for traversing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by TypeScript-ESTree. ASTs are tree representations of code, and traversing them is essential for various operations, such as static analysis, code transformation, and linting.

"Visitor keys" in this context are basically properties on AST nodes that may contain other nodes. Using these keys allows for programs to systematically visit each node in the AST in a structured manner.

The purpose of the package is to make such traversal easier by standardizing the entry points to the nodes of the TypeScript ASTs as produced by TypeScript-ESTree.

Now, I will generate the code to implement this functionality in a Node.js package:

```markdown
// index.js
const visitorKeys = {
  Program: ['body'],
  FunctionDeclaration: ['id', 'params', 'body'],
  VariableDeclaration: ['declarations'],
  VariableDeclarator: ['id', 'init'],
  ExpressionStatement: ['expression'],
  CallExpression: ['callee', 'arguments'],
  Identifier: [],
  Literal: [],
  // You can extend these keys based on TypeScript-ESTree nodes specifics
};

/**
 * Function to get visitor keys for an AST node type
 * @param {string} nodeType - The type of the AST node
 * @returns {string[]} - List of visitor keys for the given node type
 */
function getVisitorKeys(nodeType) {
  return visitorKeys[nodeType] || [];
}

/**
 * Example function to traverse an AST
 * @param {object} node - The AST node to start traversal
 * @param {function} visit - A callback function to call for every node
 */
function traverse(node, visit) {
  visit(node);
  const keys = getVisitorKeys(node.type);
  
  keys.forEach((key) => {
    const child = node[key];
    if (Array.isArray(child)) {
      child.forEach((c) => traverse(c, visit));
    } else if (child && typeof child.type === 'string') {
      traverse(child, visit);
    }
  });
}

module.exports = {
  getVisitorKeys,
  traverse,
};
```

This code defines visitor keys for a few common AST node types and provides functions to get these keys and traverse an AST. The `getVisitorKeys` function returns an array of keys reusable across AST node types, allowing callers to perform operations on child nodes. The `traverse` function is an example of how to use these visitor keys for AST traversal by calling a given `visit` function on every node it encounters. 

The implementation could be extended to include all node types supported by TypeScript-ESTree according to its specification.

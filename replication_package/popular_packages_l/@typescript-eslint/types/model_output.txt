The README.md for the `@typescript-eslint/types` package describes the purpose and role of this package within the `typescript-eslint` project. The functionality of this package can be summarized as follows:

1. **Purpose**: 
   - The package aims to reduce cyclic dependencies and provide lightweight packages at runtime.
   - It is foundational but not intended for direct usage by most end-users.

2. **Intended Usage**:
   - Users generally do not use this package directly.
   - It is more common for developers to use other packages that depend on this package, such as `@typescript-eslint/experimental-utils` when building ESLint plugins or `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` when parsing TypeScript code.

3. **Contributing**:
   - There is a link to a contributing guide for those interested in contributing to the project.

Now, I'll generate the code for a Node.js package that implements a simple structure representing the essence of this package.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  "name": "@typescript-eslint/types",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Provides types to reduce cycles and provide lightweight packages at runtime.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

// index.js
/**
 * Module representing TypeScript-ESTree types.
 * These types are intended for use by other packages in the typescript-eslint ecosystem.
 */

/**
 * Example type function for demonstration.
 * In practice, this would include actual type definitions and utilities.
 */
function exampleTypeFunction(data) {
  // Simulate processing of some TypeScript Node
  console.log('Processing data:', data);
}

module.exports = {
  exampleTypeFunction,
};

// Usage guidance (e.g., developer notes)
/*
 * Note: This package is a low-level utility and should not be used directly
 * by most consumers. Instead, consider using more high-level packages
 * such as @typescript-eslint/experimental-utils or @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree.

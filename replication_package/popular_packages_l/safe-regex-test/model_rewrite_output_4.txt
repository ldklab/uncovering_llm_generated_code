The original Node.js code is a Shell command that installs the `safe-regex-test` package using `npm`. This package helps to safely test regular expressions to ensure that they do not result in catastrophic backtracking, which can degrade performance and potentially lead to denial of service attacks.

Below is a possible rewrite of a Node.js script that demonstrates how to use the `safe-regex-test` package by installing it programmatically and providing an example of its usage:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

// Install the safe-regex-test package programmatically
exec('npm install --save safe-regex-test', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error installing safe-regex-test: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }
  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
  }
  
  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
  
  // After installation, require the package
  const safeRegexTest = require('safe-regex-test');

  // Example usage of safe-regex-test
  const regex = /([a-z]+)+/;
  const safeTest = safeRegexTest(regex);

  if (safeTest) {
    console.log('The regex is safe!');
  } else {
    console.log('The regex might be unsafe!');
  }
});
```

In this script, the `child_process` module is used to run the npm command for installing `safe-regex-test`. After successful installation, the script imports the package and provides an example of using it to check whether a regex is safe. The result of the safety check is logged to the console.

The `safe-regex-test` package provides a simple and secure way to test strings against regular expressions in JavaScript. The main functionality of this package is to create a predicate function that checks whether a given string matches a specified regular expression. What makes it "safe" is that the function returned by the package is immune to changes made to the `RegExp.prototype`. This means that even if global methods like `test` on `RegExp.prototype` are modified or overridden elsewhere in the code, the predicate function will still work correctly and independently.

### How it Works:

- The package exports a function `regexTester` that takes a regular expression (or a string pattern) as an input.
- This function then returns a new testing function. This testing function takes a string as input and returns `true` if the string matches the regular expression, and `false` otherwise.
- It uses a robust mechanism to ensure that the evaluation of the regular expression is not affected by any external changes to `RegExp.prototype`.

### Example Usage:

1. Install the package using npm:
   ```sh
   npm install --save safe-regex-test
   ```
   
2. Use the package in your JavaScript code:
   ```js
   var regexTester = require('safe-regex-test');
   var assert = require('assert');

   var tester = regexTester('a');
   assert.ok(tester('a'));     // returns true because 'a' matches the pattern 'a'
   assert.notOk(tester('b'));  // returns false because 'b' does not match the pattern 'a'
   ```

3. To run tests for the package, clone the repository, install dependencies, and execute `npm test`.

Below is the implementation of the `safe-regex-test` package:

```javascript
// safe-regex-test/index.js
function safeRegexTest(pattern, flags) {
  // Create a RegExp object initially based on the provided pattern and flag
  var re = new RegExp(pattern, flags);

  // Return a test function that checks the input string against the created RegExp
  return function testString(string) {
    return re.test(string);
  };
}

module.exports = safeRegexTest;
```

To use this module, save the code in a file named `index.js` in a directory. Publish the directory as an npm package, or use it directly in a local project as demonstrated in the usage example.

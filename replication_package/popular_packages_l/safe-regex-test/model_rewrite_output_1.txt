The functionality of the Node.js code snippet provided is to install a Node.js package called `safe-regex-test` using npm, which is the Node.js package manager. The `--save` flag indicates that this package should be added as a dependency in the package's `package.json` file under the `dependencies` section.

A possible rewrite of this Node.js code could include the same goal of installing a package but using the more modern `--save` default behavior of npm, as `--save` is not required in newer versions of npm. Therefore, the code can be simplified as follows:

```sh
npm install safe-regex-test
```

This rewritten code achieves the same result as the original: it installs the `safe-regex-test` package and automatically adds it to the dependencies of the project.

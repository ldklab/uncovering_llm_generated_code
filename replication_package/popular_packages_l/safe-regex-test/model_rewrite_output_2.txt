The Node.js code provided is a shell command intended for use in a terminal. It installs a specific npm package named `safe-regex-test` and saves it as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file. This package likely provides functionality for safely testing regular expressions to avoid issues like catastrophic backtracking, which can occur with poorly constructed regular expressions and lead to performance degradation or denial of service.

Here is the possible rewrite of the installation step with an additional example of how to use the `safe-regex-test` package in a Node.js script:

```sh
# Install the safe-regex-test package and save it to package.json
npm install --save safe-regex-test
```

```javascript
// Import the safe-regex-test package
const safeRegexTest = require('safe-regex-test');

// A regular expression pattern that we want to test safely
const pattern = /([a-z]+)+$/;

// Create a safe tester function for this pattern
const safeTest = safeRegexTest(pattern);

// Test the pattern safely against various strings
const testString1 = "abc";
const testString2 = "abc123";
const testString3 = "a".repeat(1000);

// Log results of the safe regex tests
console.log(safeTest(testString1)); // Output: true, as "abc" matches
console.log(safeTest(testString2)); // Output: false, as "abc123" does not completely match
console.log(safeTest(testString3)); // Output: true or false, depending on the regex pattern safety and input size
```

In this Node.js code snippet:
- We first import the `safe-regex-test` module.
- We define a regular expression pattern to check.
- We use the `safeRegexTest` function to create a tester for our pattern, allowing us to test strings against it safely.
- Finally, we test a few strings and log whether they match the pattern safely.

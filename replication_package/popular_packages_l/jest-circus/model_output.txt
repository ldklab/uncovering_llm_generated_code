The functionality described in the README.md for the `jest-circus` package involves providing a next-generation test runner for Jest, which is characterized by its flux-based architecture. This runner is designed to be fast, maintainable, and easy to extend. `jest-circus` allows users to bind to events by implementing an event handler in a custom environment, which can then handle various test events such as the start of a test. 

The key aspect of this functionality is the `handleTestEvent` method, which can be overridden in a custom test environment class. This method receives events and the state, allowing users to perform actions at different points in test execution without directly altering the event or state data.

Circus provides asynchronous handling of events, meaning that the test runner will pause execution until any promises returned by `handleTestEvent` are resolved. However, there are exceptions for certain events, which include: `start_describe_definition`, `finish_describe_definition`, `add_hook`, `add_test`, and `error`. These events are not awaited, mainly for backward compatibility reasons.

Since Jest 27, `jest-circus` is the default test runner, but users can still explicitly configure it in their Jest setup. Installation can be done via Yarn or npm, and the configuration can be set through the Jest configuration file or CLI options.

Here is the code for a Node.js package that implements a simple custom Jest environment using `jest-circus`:

```javascript
// my-custom-environment.js
const { TestEnvironment } = require('jest-environment-node');

class MyCustomEnvironment extends TestEnvironment {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
  }

  async handleTestEvent(event, state) {
    if (event.name === 'test_start') {
      console.log(`Test started: ${event.test.name}`);
    }
    // Handle other events as needed
  }

  async setup() {
    await super.setup();
    console.log('Custom environment setup.');
  }

  async teardown() {
    console.log('Custom environment teardown.');
    await super.teardown();
  }

  runScript(script) {
    return super.runScript(script);
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomEnvironment;

// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: './my-custom-environment',
  testRunner: 'jest-circus/runner',
};

// package.json
{
  "name": "my-jest-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sample project using custom Jest environment with jest-circus",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {

  }
}
```

This setup includes defining a custom test environment by extending Jest's NodeEnvironment. The `handleTestEvent` method allows handling of test events, printing a message to the console when a test starts. The custom environment is then specified in the `jest.config.js` to be used by Jest. The `package.json` includes dependencies required to run Jest with the custom environment.

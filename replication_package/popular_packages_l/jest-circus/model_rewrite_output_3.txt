The provided Node.js code is for setting up a custom Jest testing environment using `jest-environment-node` and `jest-circus`. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Custom Test Environment Setup**: 
   - **`MyCustomEnvironment` Class**: Inherits from `TestEnvironment` provided by `jest-environment-node`.
   - **Constructor**: Calls the parent constructor with the received config.
   - **`handleTestEvent` method**: An asynchronous method that logs a message whenever a test starts, indicating which test has begun. This method can be extended to handle additional Jest test events as required.
   - **`setup` method**: An asynchronous method called before tests run. It calls the parent class's setup method and logs a message to indicate the setup process is complete.
   - **`teardown` method**: An asynchronous method called after tests are completed. It logs a teardown message and ensures cleanup by calling the parent's teardown method.
   - **`runScript` method**: Delegates the execution of scripts back to the parent class using the inherited `runScript` method.

2. **Jest Configuration**:
   - Configured the Jest to use the custom environment defined in `my-custom-environment.js`.
   - Using `jest-circus` as the test runner, which offers better control over the lifecycle of test events.

3. **Package Configuration**:
   - `package.json` sets up a project for testing with Jest and specifies `jest` and `jest-circus` as development dependencies.
   - The test script uses Jest to run the tests defined in the project.

Below is a rewritten version of the provided code that maintains the same functionality:

```javascript
// my-custom-environment.js
const { TestEnvironment } = require('jest-environment-node');

class MyCustomEnvironment extends TestEnvironment {
  constructor(config) {
    super(config);
  }

  async handleTestEvent(event, state) {
    if (event.name === 'test_start') {
      console.log(`Test started: ${event.test.name}`);
    }
    // Additional event handling can be added here
  }

  async setup() {
    await super.setup();
    console.log('Custom environment setup.');
  }

  async teardown() {
    console.log('Custom environment teardown.');
    await super.teardown();
  }

  runScript(script) {
    return super.runScript(script);
  }
}

module.exports = MyCustomEnvironment;

// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: './my-custom-environment',
  testRunner: 'jest-circus/runner',
};

// package.json

The code implements a custom HTTP agent by extending Node.js's `http.Agent`. The custom agent, named `MyAgent`, provides the functionality to create TCP connections for HTTP requests and TLS connections for HTTPS requests. This is done by overriding the `connect` method, which checks whether the request requires a secure connection (HTTPS) and creates the appropriate type of connection using either the `net` or `tls` modules. An instance of this custom agent is used to make an HTTP GET request to the Node.js API documentation, where the response is logged to the console, along with its headers, and piped to the standard output.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// agent-base.js - A custom HTTP agent using Node.js built-in capabilities

const net = require('net');
const tls = require('tls');
const http = require('http');
const { Agent: BaseAgent } = require('http');

/**
 * Custom agent class that extends the default HTTP Agent to support HTTP and HTTPS.
 */
class MyAgent extends BaseAgent {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    super(options);
  }

  /**
   * Method to establish a connection based on request type (HTTP/HTTPS).
   * @param {Object} req - The request object.
   * @param {Object} opts - Connection options, includes secureEndpoint flag.
   */
  connect(req, opts) {
    return opts.secureEndpoint ? tls.connect(opts) : net.connect(opts);
  }
}

// Example of how to use the MyAgent instance
const agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });

http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

The provided Node.js code defines a custom HTTP agent called `MyAgent`. This agent extends Node.js's built-in `http.Agent` to manage connections for HTTP requests. It includes a method `connect` to establish either a plain TCP connection for HTTP or a TLS connection for HTTPS based on the request options. The `MyAgent` instance is used in an example HTTP GET request to the Node.js API documentation, demonstrating its functionality, with the response being logged and piped to the standard output.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const net = require('net');
const tls = require('tls');
const http = require('http');
const { Agent: HttpAgent } = require('http');

class CustomAgent extends HttpAgent {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    super(options);
  }

  createConnection(options) {
    return options.secureEndpoint ? tls.connect(options) : net.connect(options);
  }
}

const myAgent = new CustomAgent({ keepAlive: true });

http.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent: myAgent }, (response) => {
  console.log('Received response headers:', response.headers);
  response.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

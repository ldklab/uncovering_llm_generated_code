The `eslint-plugin-import` package is designed to enhance the ESLint ecosystem by providing linting support specifically for the ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax. It aims to help developers maintain clean and bug-free code by preventing common errors associated with misspelled file paths, incorrect import/export statements, and other module-related issues. 

### Core Functionalities:
- **Linting Rules**: The package offers a comprehensive set of rules that support various aspects of import/export syntax in JavaScript. These rules help enforce best practices, prevent common errors, and improve code readability and maintainability.
  
- **Helpful Warnings**: Provide warnings for issues like invalid exports, deprecated imports, empty import statements, dynamic `require` calls, etc. These warnings are configurable based on the project's needs.
  
- **Static Analysis**: Ensures static analysis of imports for validations like checking unresolved modules, circular dependencies, default exports presence, etc.

- **Style Guide Enforcement**: Helps in maintaining a consistent code style across a project by setting rules around import order, newline after imports, forbidding namespace imports, and more.

- **Configuration Options**:
  - The plugin offers both legacy configuration using `.eslintrc` files and new flat configuration using `eslint.config.js`.
  - Allows integration into existing projects via direct rule configuration or by extending recommended preset configurations.
  
- **Integration with TypeScript**: Special configuration options are available when using TypeScript, ensuring that linting works seamlessly with TypeScript's module system.

- **Resolvers**: Support for custom module resolution strategies beyond Node's built-in resolver, fitting more complex setups like Webpack.

- **Caching**: Provides settings for caching to improve performance, especially for long-running processes like development servers.

- **Enterprise Support and Customization**: The package can be customized with third-party resolvers or proprietary resolver implementations to meet enterprise-specific requirements.

### Installation and Configuration:
To use this plugin, the package needs to be installed in development dependencies, and minimal configuration should be added to the ESLint configuration file to enable desired rules and settings.

Here is a sample Node.js package that implements the described functionalities.

```javascript
// File: package.json
{
  "name": "eslint-plugin-import-sample",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.30.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}

// File: .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    'plugin:import/recommended'
  ],
  settings: {
    'import/resolver': {
      node: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.mjs', '.json']
      }
    }
  },
  rules: {
    'import/no-unresolved': 'error',
    'import/named': 'error',
    'import/namespace': 'error',
    'import/default': 'error',
    'import/export': 'error'
  }
};

// File: index.js
import { example } from './example.js';

// File: example.js
export const example = () => {
  console.log("Example function");
};

// File: README.md
# Sample ESLint Plugin Import Project

This is a sample implementation using `eslint-plugin-import` to enforce import/export rules and ensure proper module resolution in a project.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run ESLint:
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

## Configuration

The project uses an `.eslintrc.js` configuration to set up `eslint-plugin-import`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
   extends: [
     'eslint:recommended',
     'plugin:import/recommended'
   ],
   rules: {
     // Add or modify rules here
   }
};
```
```

This setup allows developers to ensure that their import and export statements adhere to best practices, reducing errors related to module resolution and syntax across the project.

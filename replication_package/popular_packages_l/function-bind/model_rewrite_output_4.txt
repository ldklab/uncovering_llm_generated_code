The Node.js code provided imports the `function-bind` module and assigns its exported function to the built-in `Function.prototype.bind`. This essentially polyfills or extends the environment to provide or overwrite the native `Function.prototype.bind` functionality with the implementation from the `function-bind` package.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const functionBind = require("function-bind");
Function.prototype.bind = functionBind;
```

This rewritten code achieves the same functionality by first requiring the `function-bind` package into a variable and then assigning it to `Function.prototype.bind`.

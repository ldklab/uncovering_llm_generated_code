The functionality of the Node.js code provided is to require and assign the `function-bind` module to the `bind` method of the `Function` prototype. This means that the bind method from the `function-bind` package is being attached to all function objects, allowing them to use this external implementation of the `bind` method.

A possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
// Require the 'function-bind' module
const functionBind = require("function-bind");

// Assign it to the Function prototype's bind method
Function.prototype.bind = functionBind;
```

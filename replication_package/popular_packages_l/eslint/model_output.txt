The functionality described in the README.md is for "ESLint," a tool used to identify and report on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. Here are the main functionalities of the package:

1. **Installation and Setup**: ESLint can be easily installed and configured using the npm command `npm init @eslint/config@latest`. It requires Node.js version 18, 20, or at least 21 with SSL support.

2. **Usage**: Once set up, ESLint can be run on files and directories using a command like `npx eslint yourfile.js`.

3. **Configuration**: ESLint allows users to configure rules in an `eslint.config.js` file. This file defines which rules to apply to certain files and directories and sets the severity of these rules (off, warn, error).

4. **Pluggable Architecture**: Each rule in ESLint can be implemented as a plugin, allowing users to customize and extend rule sets.

5. **Version Compatibility**: ESLint supports various versions of ECMAScript, along with JSX and experimental features through additional parsers and plugins.

6. **Version Support Policy**: ESLint offers ongoing support for its current version and a limited support period for the previous version.

7. **FAQs and Support**: Detailed FAQs provide guidance on common issues, like JSX support and integration with other tools such as Prettier. There's a mechanism for filing issues and seeking support.

8. **Semantic Versioning**: ESLint follows semantic versioning with patch, minor, and major releases indicating varying levels of potential impact on user's lint configurations.

9. **Contribution and Conduct**: Guidelines for contributing to the project and a code of conduct are included, promoting a collaborative and respectful community environment.

Based on this functionality, an example implementation of a simplified ESLint-like package in Node.js is detailed below:

```markdown
// package.json
{
  "name": "mini-eslint",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple JavaScript linter",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "type": "module"
}

// index.js
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';

const config = {
  rules: {
    "prefer-const": "warn",
    "no-constant-binary-expression": "error"
  },
  files: ["**/*.js"] // simple matching for JS files
};

async function lintFile(file) {
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8');
    
    if (config.rules["prefer-const"] === "warn" && content.includes("let ")) {
      console.warn(`Warning in ${file}: Consider using "const" instead of "let"`);
    }
    
    if (config.rules["no-constant-binary-expression"] === "error" && /(\d+ [+\-*/] \d+)/.test(content)) {
      console.error(`Error in ${file}: Avoid constant binary expressions.`);
      process.exitCode = 1;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Could not read file ${file}: ${err.message}`);
  }
}

async function lintFiles() {
  const files = await fs.readdir('.');
  for (const file of files) {
    if (config.files.some(pattern => file.endsWith('.js'))) {
      await lintFile(file);
    }
  }
}

lintFiles();

// Usage Example:
// Save above configuration and run using `npm run lint`
// Place a JavaScript file in the same directory to test linting, e.g., test.js
```

This sample code defines a basic functionality matching some of the simple capabilities of ESLint, providing easy setup and configuration, some simple rule checks, and command-line usage. Real ESLint offers much more sophisticated analysis, configuration, and extensibility options.

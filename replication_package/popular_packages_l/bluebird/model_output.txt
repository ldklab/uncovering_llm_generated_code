The README.md describes a Node.js package called Bluebird, which is a promise library that provides additional features over the native JavaScript promises. This library focuses on innovative features and high performance. Bluebird is designed to comply with the Promises/A+ specification, ensuring a standardized behavior of promises. 

Key features that are emphasized include:
- **Cancellation**: Allows you to cancel promises, which is not supported by native promises.
- **Iteration Methods**: Provides utilities for working with collections of promises, such as `Promise.map`, `Promise.each`, etc.
- **Warnings**: Offers improved debugging capabilities by showing warnings for common mistakes in promise handling.

The README suggests that due to the performance improvements in recent versions of Node.js, users who selected Bluebird solely for performance reasons should consider using native promises. 

Bluebird is distributed under the MIT License, allowing for broad use, modification, and distribution of the software. 

Below is a simplified implementation of a custom promise library that captures some of the described functionalities, such as basic promise handling and cancellation:

```javascript
// bluebird-lite.js
class BluebirdLite {
  constructor(executor) {
    this.state = 'pending';
    this.value = null;
    this.handlers = [];
    this.cancelRequested = false;

    const resolve = (value) => {
      if (this.cancelRequested) return;
      this.updateState('fulfilled', value);
    };

    const reject = (reason) => {
      if (this.cancelRequested) return;
      this.updateState('rejected', reason);
    };

    try {
      executor(resolve, reject);
    } catch (error) {
      reject(error);
    }
  }

  updateState(state, value) {
    if (this.state !== 'pending') return;
    this.state = state;
    this.value = value;
    this.handlers.forEach((handler) => this.handle(handler));
  }

  handle(handler) {
    if (this.state === 'pending') {
      this.handlers.push(handler);
    } else {
      const cb = this.state === 'fulfilled' ? handler.onFulfilled : handler.onRejected;
      if (!cb) {
        cb = this.state === 'fulfilled' ? handler.resolve : handler.reject;
        cb(this.value);
        return;
      }
      try {
        const result = cb(this.value);
        handler.resolve(result);
      } catch (error) {
        handler.reject(error);
      }
    }
  }

  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    return new BluebirdLite((resolve, reject) => {
      this.handle({
        onFulfilled,
        onRejected,
        resolve,
        reject,
      });
    });
  }

  catch(onRejected) {
    return this.then(null, onRejected);
  }

  cancel() {
    if (this.state === 'pending') {
      this.cancelRequested = true;
      this.updateState('cancelled', 'Promise was cancelled');
    }
  }

  static resolve(value) {
    return new BluebirdLite((resolve) => resolve(value));
  }

  static reject(reason) {
    return new BluebirdLite((_, reject) => reject(reason));
  }

  static all(promises) {
    return new BluebirdLite((resolve, reject) => {
      let count = 0;
      const results = [];
      if (promises.length === 0) resolve([]);

      const addResult = (i, value) => {
        results[i] = value;
        count += 1;
        if (count === promises.length) {
          resolve(results);
        }
      };

      promises.forEach((promise, i) => {
        promise.then(value => addResult(i, value))
               .catch(reject);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = BluebirdLite;

// Usage example
const { log } = console;
const bluebirdLite = require('./bluebird-lite');

const promise1 = new bluebirdLite((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Result 1'), 1000);
});

const promise2 = bluebirdLite.resolve('Result 2');

bluebirdLite.all([promise1, promise2]).then(results => {
  log(results); // Output: ['Result 1', 'Result 2']
}).catch(err => {
  log('Error:', err);
});
```

Note that this is a simplified example and does not cover all features of the actual Bluebird library. Implementing full compliance with Promises/A+ specification and additional Bluebird-specific features would require more intricate handling and abstraction.

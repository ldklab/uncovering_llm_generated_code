The provided Node.js code is a simple implementation of a gRPC client using the `@grpc/grpc-js` package. The client is capable of handling different types of gRPC calls which include unary calls, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming.

1. **Loading the Protocol Buffer Definitions**: 
   - The code begins by loading a `.proto` file with the package `@grpc/proto-loader` which contains the gRPC service definition. This is necessary to understand the structure of the requests and responses.
   
2. **Creating the Client**: 
   - A client for the `ExampleService` is then created. This client uses an insecure channel (meaning no SSL/TLS is being used) to communicate with a server that's running on `localhost` at port `50051`.

3. **Unary Call**:
   - This section demonstrates a unary call where a single request is sent to the server, and you receive a single response back. The request contains a single parameter `{ name: 'World' }`, and the callback logs the result or an error.
   
4. **Server Streaming**:
   - In server streaming, the client sends one request and expects one or more replies streamed back. The client listens for 'data' events to handle each piece of message received, and listens for an 'end' event signaling that the stream has concluded.

5. **Client Streaming**:
   - This example shows how the client can send a sequence of messages to the server. The client sends multiple messages ('Hello' and 'World') and ends the stream with `call.end()`. A callback handles the serverâ€™s response or an error.

6. **Bidirectional Streaming**: 
   - In bidirectional streaming, both the client and server can send a sequence of messages. The client writes messages to the stream and simultaneously listens for messages from the server, handling 'data' and 'end' events.

The rewritten version of this code preserves its functionality as described.

```javascript
// myGrpcClient.js: A simple gRPC Client implemented using @grpc/grpc-js

const grpc = require('@grpc/grpc-js');
const protoLoader = require('@grpc/proto-loader');

// Load the .proto file
const PROTO_PATH = './example.proto';
const packageDefinition = protoLoader.loadSync(PROTO_PATH, {
  keepCase: true,
  enums: String,
  longs: String,
  defaults: true,
  oneofs: true
});
const ExampleService = grpc.loadPackageDefinition(packageDefinition).example.ExampleService;

// Create the gRPC client
const client = new ExampleService('localhost:50051', grpc.credentials.createInsecure());

// Unary call example
client.unaryCall({ name: 'World' }, (error, response) => {
  error ? console.error('Error:', error) : console.log('Greeting:', response.message);
});

// Server streaming call example
const serverStream = client.serverStreamingCall({ start: 0 });
serverStream.on('data', response => console.log('Received:', response.message));
serverStream.on('end', () => console.log('Stream ended'));

// Client streaming call example
const clientStream = client.clientStreamingCall((error, response) => {
  error ? console.error('Error:', error) : console.log('Final Response:', response.message);
});
clientStream.write({ message: 'Hello' });
clientStream.write({ message: 'World' });
clientStream.end();

// Bidirectional streaming call example
const bidiStream = client.bidiStreamingCall();
bidiStream.on('data', response => console.log('Received:', response.message));
bidiStream.on('end', () => console.log('Bidirectional Stream ended'));
bidiStream.write({ message: 'Hello' });
bidiStream.write({ message: 'World' });
bidiStream.end();

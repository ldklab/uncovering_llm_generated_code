The Node.js code imports and re-exports all functionalities of the built-in 'path' module. The `path` module in Node.js provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. By requiring and then immediately exporting it, this code makes all the functionalities of the 'path' module available to any module that imports this file. 

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
// Import the built-in 'path' module
const path = require('path');

// Export all functionalities of the 'path' module
module.exports = path;
```

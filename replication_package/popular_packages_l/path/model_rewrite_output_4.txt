The given Node.js code exports all the functionalities provided by the built-in Node.js `'path'` module. The `require('path')` statement imports the entire `'path'` module, and the `module.exports` statement makes it available to other files that require this `'index.js'` file. Essentially, this code acts as a passthrough, re-exporting the `'path'` module functionalities.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// Import and immediately export the entire 'path' module
const path = require('path');

module.exports = path;
```

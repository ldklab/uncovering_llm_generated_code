The Node.js package `path` described in the README.md file is a direct copy of the built-in Node.js 'path' module that is made available through the NPM registry. It essentially allows developers to use Path-related utilities that are originally available in Node.js, such as working with file and directory paths, in a more modular way by including them explicitly via npm. The functionality provided by this package would be exactly what you would expect from the 'path' module that is a part of the Node.js standard library. The README provides a link to the official documentation and mentions that it can be installed using npm. The "License" section indicates that the package is distributed under the MIT License.

Here is the code for a Node.js package that replicates the functionality of the built-in Node.js 'path' module:

```js
// path/index.js

// Exporting all the functions from the original node 'path' module
module.exports = require('path');
```

```json
// path/package.json

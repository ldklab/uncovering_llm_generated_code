The provided Node.js code exports all functionalities of the built-in Node.js 'path' module. Essentially, it re-exports the entire module, allowing other files to import this 'path/index.js' file and gain direct access to all the functionalities offered by Node.js's native 'path' module.

Here's a possible rewrite of the Node.js code following the explanation:

```javascript
// path/index.js

// Re-exporting the entire functionality of Node.js's built-in 'path' module
const pathModule = require('path');
module.exports = pathModule;
```

The `es-define-property` package is a Node.js module that provides a functionality similar to `Object.defineProperty`, but with enhancements to account for certain JavaScript environments where `Object.defineProperty` might not work as expected. Specifically, it addresses compatibility issues with Internet Explorer 8, which has a non-standard implementation of `Object.defineProperty`.

The package exports a function that:
- Returns the native `Object.defineProperty` if the environment supports it properly.
- Returns `false` if the environment is IE 8, where `Object.defineProperty` is known to be broken.
- Returns `false` if the environment is ES3, which does not have `Object.defineProperty`.

The functionality is demonstrated using condition checks where the exported function is compared with `Object.defineProperty` and `false` to determine the environment compatibility.

Here is the implementation of the package:

```js
// es-define-property implementation
'use strict';

var supportsDefineProperty = (function() {
    try {
        var obj = {};
        Object.defineProperty(obj, 'test', { value: 42 });
        return obj.test === 42;
    } catch (err) {
        return false;
    }
})();

module.exports = supportsDefineProperty ? Object.defineProperty : false;
```

The code checks if `Object.defineProperty` works as expected by trying to define a test property on an object and verifying its value. If it succeeds, it means `Object.defineProperty` is supported properly, and the package exports this native method. If it fails, indicating that the environment is likely IE 8 or an older ES3, it exports `false`.

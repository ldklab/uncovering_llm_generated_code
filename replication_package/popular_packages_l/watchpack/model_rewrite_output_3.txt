The provided Node.js code defines a `Watchpack` class that extends the `EventEmitter` class to watch file system changes in specified directories. Here's the functionality broken down:

1. **Initialization**: 
    - The `Watchpack` class constructor initializes various properties, including options, maps for active watchers, and sets for aggregated changes and removals. It also sets up an aggregation timer based on the options provided.

2. **File Watching**:
    - The `watch` method sets up watchers on specified directories. It first clears existing watchers and then attaches a new watcher to each directory using `fs.watch`.
    - Each watcher tracks changes in directories and on detecting a change, invokes the `_notifyChange` method.

3. **Change Notification and Aggregation**:
    - The `_notifyChange` method handles the event of file modifications and renames, emitting a "change" event with the file path and change type. 
    - If aggregation is enabled, it will delay the firing of an "aggregated" event by the specified timeout, at which point it emits the sets of aggregated changes and removals.

4. **Control Methods**:
    - The `pause` method stops all active watchers but keeps them in memory.
    - The `close` method stops watchers and clears them from memory.
    - The `getAggregated` method provides a snapshot of the current aggregated changes and removals.

5. **Module Export**:
    - The class is exported for use in other modules.

Here's a possible rewrite of this Node.js code:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

class Watchpack extends EventEmitter {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    super();
    this.options = options;
    this.watchers = new Map();
    this.aggregatedChanges = new Set();
    this.aggregatedRemovals = new Set();
    this.aggregateTimeout = options.aggregateTimeout || 0;
    this.aggregationTimer = null;
  }

  watch({ files = [], directories = [], missing = [], startTime = Date.now() } = {}) {
    this.close();
    directories.forEach(dir => this._watchDirectory(dir));
  }

  _watchDirectory(dir) {
    if (!this.watchers.has(dir)) {
      const watcher = fs.watch(dir, (eventType, filename) => {
        if (filename) {
          this._notifyChange(path.join(dir, filename), eventType);
        }
      });
      this.watchers.set(dir, watcher);
    }
  }

  _notifyChange(filePath, eventType) {
    const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
    const mtime = stats.mtimeMs;
    
    if (eventType === 'rename' || eventType === 'change') {
      this.aggregatedChanges.add(filePath);
      this.emit("change", filePath, mtime, `Detected ${eventType}`);
    }

    if (this.aggregateTimeout) {
      clearTimeout(this.aggregationTimer);
      this.aggregationTimer = setTimeout(() => {
        this.emit("aggregated", this.aggregatedChanges, this.aggregatedRemovals);
        this.aggregatedChanges.clear();
        this.aggregatedRemovals.clear();
      }, this.aggregateTimeout);
    }
  }

  pause() {
    this.watchers.forEach(watcher => watcher.close());
  }

  close() {
    this.pause();
    this.watchers.clear();
  }

  getAggregated() {
    return {
      changes: new Set(this.aggregatedChanges),
      removals: new Set(this.aggregatedRemovals)
    };
  }
}

module.exports = Watchpack;

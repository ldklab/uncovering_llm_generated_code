The provided Node.js code defines a small application state management example using the `reselect` library in TypeScript. It focuses on filtering completed todos from the application's state while using memoization for optimization. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **Define the State Interface**: The `RootState` interface specifies the shape of the application state, which includes `todos` and `alerts`.

2. **State Initialization**: A variable `state` is initialized as a sample `RootState` object, containing arrays of todo items and alerts, each with specific properties (`id`, `completed` for todos and `read` for alerts).

3. **Input Selector**: `selectTodos`, a simple function, extracts the `todos` array from the application state.

4. **Memoized Selector**: `selectCompletedTodos` is created using `createSelector` from `reselect`. It takes the `selectTodos` selector as input and returns a new array containing only completed todos. This selector uses memoization to optimize performance by caching the results for identical inputs.

5. **Usage**: The `selectCompletedTodos` selector is called twice with the same state, and due to memoization, the result from the second call is fetched from cache, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.

Here's the possible restructured version of the code:

```typescript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

// Define the interface for the application state
interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[];
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[];
}

// Initialize the state with sample data
const state: RootState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, completed: false },
    { id: 1, completed: true }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 0, read: false },
    { id: 1, read: true }
  ]
};

// Define an input selector to extract todos from the state
const selectTodos = (state: RootState) => state.todos;

// Define a memoized selector to filter completed todos
const selectCompletedTodos = createSelector(
  [selectTodos],
  todos => todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)
);

// Use the memoized selector
console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // Computes and logs completed todos
console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // Returns cached result and logs it
```

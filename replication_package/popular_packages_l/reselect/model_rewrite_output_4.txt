The provided Node.js code defines a simple example using the `reselect` library to create a memoized selector for filtering completed todo items from a Redux-like state. 

1. **RootState Interface**: It defines the structure of the application state with `todos` and `alerts` properties, each being an array of objects representing todos and alerts, respectively.
   
2. **State Object**: This is a sample state matching the `RootState` interface, with example data for `todos` and `alerts`.

3. **Input Selector**: The `selectTodos` function is an input selector that returns the `todos` array from the state.

4. **Memoized Selector**: The `selectCompletedTodos` is a memoized selector created using `createSelector` from `reselect`. It filters the `todos` to return only those which are completed. Memoization ensures that if the input state has not changed, the selector returns the cached result instead of recalculating.

5. **Console Output**: The code logs the result of `selectCompletedTodos(state)` twice. On the first run, it calculates the filtered todos and caches the result. On subsequent runs with the same input, it returns the cached result instead of recalculating.

Here is the rewritten code:

```typescript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

// Define the application state shape
interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[];
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[];
}

// Sample state initialized with todos and alerts
const state: RootState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, completed: false },
    { id: 1, completed: true }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 0, read: false },
    { id: 1, read: true }
  ]
};

// Input Selector to extract todos from the state
const selectTodos = (state: RootState) => state.todos;

// Memoized Selector to filter and return completed todos
const selectCompletedTodos = createSelector(
  [selectTodos],
  (todos) => todos.filter((todo) => todo.completed)
);

// Logging completed todos
console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // First run, calculates
console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // Second run, returns cached result
```

The provided Node.js code uses the `reselect` library to create a memoized selector for filtering completed todos from the application's state. Here's an explanation of its functionality:

1. **State Definition:** 
   - A type `RootState` is defined, which describes the shape of the state object that includes `todos` and `alerts`.
   - A state object `state` is initialized adhering to the `RootState` interface, containing an array of todo objects and alert objects.

2. **Input Selector:** 
   - `selectTodos`: A function that takes the entire state and returns just the `todos` array portion of it.

3. **Memoized Selector:**
   - `selectCompletedTodos`: Created using `createSelector` from the `reselect` library, it filters out todos that are completed. This selector is memoized, meaning it caches its output for the same input, avoiding unnecessary recalculations on subsequent calls with unchanged input.

4. **Logging Results:** 
   - The code logs the filtered list of completed todos twice. The first call results in computation, while the second call returns the cached result from the first without recomputation, demonstrating the benefit of memoization.

Hereâ€™s the rewritten code following the described functionality:

```typescript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[];
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[];
}

const state: RootState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, completed: false },
    { id: 1, completed: true }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 0, read: false },
    { id: 1, read: true }
  ]
};

// Input Selector to retrieve todos array from the state
const selectTodos = (state: RootState) => state.todos;

// Memoized Selector to filter completed todos
const selectCompletedTodos = createSelector(
  [selectTodos],
  todos => todos.filter(todo => todo.completed)
);

console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // Logs completed todos, calculates first time
console.log(selectCompletedTodos(state)); // Logs again, utilizes cache
```

The provided Node.js code uses the `reselect` library to create a memoized selector for a Redux-like state object. This selector efficiently retrieves a list of completed todos from the application's state. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **State Definition**: An interface `RootState` is defined which includes `todos` and `alerts` arrays. The `state` constant is an object conforming to this interface with sample data.

2. **Input Selector**: `selectTodos` is a simple function that accepts the application state and returns the list of todos. This function acts as an input selector.

3. **Memoized Selector**: `selectCompletedTodos` is created using `createSelector` from the `reselect` library. It takes the result from `selectTodos` and filters the todos to return only the completed ones. This selector is memoized, meaning it caches the result of its computation, and if it's called with the same input again, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing.

4. **Usage and Caching Demonstration**: When calling `selectCompletedTodos` with the `state`, the first console log calculates the completed todos, while the second log demonstrates the caching capability by returning the cached result if the state hasn't changed.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code with the same functionality:

```typescript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

interface RootState {
  todos: { id: number; completed: boolean }[];
  alerts: { id: number; read: boolean }[];
}

const initialState: RootState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, completed: false },
    { id: 1, completed: true }
  ],
  alerts: [
    { id: 0, read: false },
    { id: 1, read: true }
  ]
};

// Input Selector
const getTodos = (state: RootState) => state.todos;

// Memoized Selector
const getCompletedTodos = createSelector(
  [getTodos],
  todosList => todosList.filter(todo => todo.completed)
);

console.log(getCompletedTodos(initialState)); // First call, processes data
console.log(getCompletedTodos(initialState)); // Second call, uses memoized result
```

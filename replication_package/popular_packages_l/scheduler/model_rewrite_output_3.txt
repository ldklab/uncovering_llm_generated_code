The given Node.js code defines a `Scheduler` class, which manages a queue of tasks that should be executed during idle periods. Here's how it works:

1. **taskQueue**: The `Scheduler` maintains a queue (`taskQueue`) for storing tasks (callbacks) that will be executed when the system is idle.

2. **addTask(callback)**: This method adds a new task to the queue. After adding a task, it calls `scheduleNextTask()` to ensure that the task is eventually run.

3. **scheduleNextTask()**: This method checks if there are any tasks in the queue. If there are tasks and no ongoing idle callback (indicated by `requestIdleCallbackId` being `null`), it uses `requestIdleCallback()` to schedule execution during the browserâ€™s idle periods.

4. **runTasks(deadline)**: This method runs tasks from the queue as long as the queue is not empty and there is available idle time (`deadline.timeRemaining() > 0`). It dequeues and executes tasks one by one. After running the tasks, if the queue is still not empty, it schedules the next batch of tasks.

5. **requestIdleCallback() function**: This function simulates the behavior of the `requestIdleCallback` API in a Node.js environment, as Node.js does not have this API. It uses `setTimeout` to mimic calling the callback when the system is "idle," passing a dummy `deadline` object with a high remaining time.

6. **Global Assignment**: The function `requestIdleCallback` is assigned as a global function to simulate a browser-like environment within Node.js.

```javascript
class Scheduler {
  constructor() {
    this.taskQueue = [];
    this.requestIdleCallbackId = null;
  }

  addTask(callback) {
    this.taskQueue.push(callback);
    this.scheduleNextTask();
  }

  scheduleNextTask() {
    if (this.taskQueue.length > 0 && !this.requestIdleCallbackId) {
      this.requestIdleCallbackId = requestIdleCallback((deadline) => this.runTasks(deadline));
    }
  }

  runTasks(deadline) {
    while (this.taskQueue.length > 0 && deadline.timeRemaining() > 0) {
      const task = this.taskQueue.shift();
      task();
    }

    this.requestIdleCallbackId = null;

    if (this.taskQueue.length > 0) {
      this.scheduleNextTask();
    }
  }
}

// Usage example:
const scheduler = new Scheduler();

scheduler.addTask(() => console.log('Task 1'));
scheduler.addTask(() => console.log('Task 2'));
scheduler.addTask(() => console.log('Task 3'));

function requestIdleCallback(callback) {
  // Fallback for Node.js environment, where requestIdleCallback is not implemented
  return setTimeout(() => {
    callback({
      timeRemaining() {
        return Number.MAX_VALUE; // Some very large time remaining to simulate idle time
      }
    });
  }, 0);
}

global.requestIdleCallback = requestIdleCallback; // Simulate browser environment
```

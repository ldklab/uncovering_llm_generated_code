The given Node.js code defines a utility function `reusify` that helps in creating an object pool with reusable instances of a given constructor. This is useful for optimizing resource use by avoiding the cost of creating new objects frequently, especially in performance-critical applications.

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

- The `reusify` function takes a `Constructor` as an argument and creates an object pool.
- Within `reusify`, two variables, `head` and `tail`, are initialized. They refer to instances of the given `Constructor`. Initially, both `head` and `tail` point to the same new instance.
- `get` is a function that retrieves an available object from the pool. If the `head` has a `next` object, it reuses it; otherwise, it creates a new instance of `Constructor` and resets the `tail` to this new instance.
- `release` is a function that takes an object and returns it to the pool for future reuse, effectively appending it to the end of the pool by updating the `next` reference of the `tail`.
- The `reusify` function returns an object with `get` and `release` methods for managing the pool and its objects.

Below is a possible rewritten version of this Node.js code following the explained functionality:

```javascript
'use strict';

function reusify(Constructor) {
  let head = new Constructor();
  let tail = head;

  function get() {
    let current = head;

    if (current.next !== null) {
      head = current.next;
    } else {
      head = new Constructor();
      tail = head;
    }

    current.next = null;
    return current;
  }

  function release(obj) {
    obj.next = null;
    tail.next = obj;
    tail = obj;
  }

  return {
    get,
    release
  };
}

module.exports = reusify;
```

The provided Node.js code defines and exports a function named `reusify`. This function takes a constructor (a function that is used to create objects) as an argument and returns an object with two methods: `get` and `release`.

- The `reusify` function initializes a "linked list" of reusable objects using instances of the specified constructor. It starts with a single object (`head`) and maintains a reference to the last object in the list (`tail`).

- The `get` method is used to retrieve an object from the list. If the current `head` object has a `next` property, it returns the `head` and moves the `head` to the next object in the list. If `head.next` is `null`, it creates a new object using the constructor, and this new object becomes both the `head` and the `tail`.

- The `release` method takes an object argument and appends it to the end of the object's linked list after nullifying its `next` property. This makes the object reusable for future `get` operations.

```javascript
'use strict';

function reusify(Constructor) {
  let head = new Constructor();
  let tail = head;

  function get() {
    const current = head;

    if (current.next) {
      head = current.next;
    } else {
      head = new Constructor();
      tail = head;
    }

    current.next = null;
    return current;
  }

  function release(obj) {
    obj.next = null;
    tail.next = obj;
    tail = obj;
  }

  return {
    get,
    release
  };
}

module.exports = reusify;

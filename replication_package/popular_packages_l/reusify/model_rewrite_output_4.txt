The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to manage a pool of reusable objects. This is done through the `reusify` function, which employs a linked list to maintain objects for reuse.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- The `reusify` function takes a `Constructor` as its parameter and initializes the pool with an instance of this constructor called `head`. The `tail` variable keeps track of the end of the list.
- The `get` function checks if there is an object in the pool (i.e., if `head.next` exists). If so, it advances `head` to the next available object and returns the current object, otherwise, it creates a new object using the `Constructor`.
- The `release` function is used to reintroduce an object back into the pool, appending it to the end of the list and updating the `tail`.
- The function exports an object containing the `get` and `release` functions, which allow users to check out objects from the pool and return them when they are no longer needed.

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

function reusablePool(Constructor) {
  let poolHead = new Constructor();
  let poolTail = poolHead;

  function acquire() {
    let current;
    if (poolHead.next) {
      current = poolHead;
      poolHead = poolHead.next;
    } else {
      current = new Constructor();
    }

    current.next = null;
    return current;
  }

  function recycle(obj) {
    obj.next = null;
    poolTail.next = obj;
    poolTail = obj;
  }

  return {
    acquire: acquire,
    recycle: recycle
  };
}

module.exports = reusablePool;
```

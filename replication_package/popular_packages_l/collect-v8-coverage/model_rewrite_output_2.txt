The provided Node.js code defines a class `CoverageInstrumenter`, which uses the `inspector` module to interact with the V8 JavaScript engine. The primary purpose of this class is to collect code coverage data. The `CoverageInstrumenter` class has two main methods: `startInstrumenting` and `stopInstrumenting`.

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The constructor initializes and connects a new inspector session, which allows it to send commands to the Node.js runtime for collecting coverage data.

2. **startInstrumenting:**
   - This method enables the profiler and starts precise code coverage collection. It uses the promises to asynchronously handle the execution of commands. The `callCount` and `detailed` options ensure that the coverage data includes the number of times functions are called and detailed coverage information.

3. **stopInstrumenting:**
   - This method stops the coverage collection by taking precise coverage data and then stopping and disabling the profiler. It also handles errors using promises and returns the coverage result.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// collect-v8-coverage/index.js
const inspector = require('inspector');

class CoverageInstrumenter {
  constructor() {
    this.session = new inspector.Session();
    this.session.connect();
  }

  async startInstrumenting() {
    try {
      await this.sendCommand('Profiler.enable');
      await this.sendCommand('Profiler.startPreciseCoverage', { callCount: true, detailed: true });
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async stopInstrumenting() {
    try {
      const coverage = await this.sendCommand('Profiler.takePreciseCoverage');
      await this.sendCommand('Profiler.stopPreciseCoverage');
      await this.sendCommand('Profiler.disable');
      return coverage.result;
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  sendCommand(method, params = {}) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.session.post(method, params, (error, result) => {
        if (error) {
          return reject(error);
        }
        resolve(result);
      });
    });
  }
}

module.exports = { CoverageInstrumenter };
```

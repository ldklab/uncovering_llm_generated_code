The functionality described in the README.md for the "webpack CLI" is a command-line tool for working with webpack, a popular module bundler for JavaScript. This CLI enhances the development experience by allowing users to run webpack commands more efficiently and with more flexibility. Here's a breakdown of what the CLI offers:

1. **Installation:** The tool can be installed as a development dependency in a Node.js project using npm or yarn. It's part of the default setup if you follow webpack's Getting Started guide.

2. **Basic Usage:** The CLI is used via the command line with the syntax `npx webpack-cli [command] [options]`. If no command is specified, it defaults to the `bundle` command, which packages modules using webpack.

3. **Help Command:** Users can access help information using `npx webpack-cli --help` to see basic commands and arguments or `--help=verbose` for more detailed information.

4. **Commands:** 
    - `build` or `bundle`: To run webpack and bundle the files.
    - `configtest`: To validate a given webpack configuration.
    - `info`: Outputs system information relevant to webpack.
    - `init`: Initializes a new webpack project.
    - `loader`: Scaffolds a new loader.
    - `plugin`: Scaffolds a new plugin.
    - `serve`: Runs a development server.
    - `version`: Outputs the versions of webpack-related tools.
    - `watch`: Runs webpack in watch mode to detect changes in files.

5. **Options:** There are numerous options to customize behavior such as specifying a configuration file, setting the environment, merging configurations, enabling progress display, etc.

6. **Exit Codes:** It uses standardized exit codes to indicate success or errors (0 for success, 1 for webpack errors, 2 for configuration issues or internal errors).

7. **Environment Variables:** The CLI and configuration files can access specific environment variables that dictate behavior during execution, like forcing ESM config loading or skipping local CLI instances.

Here is a basic implementation of this functionality in a Node.js package:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// List of commands and their shorthands
const commands = {
    build: 'webpack',
    bundle: 'webpack',
    b: 'webpack',

    configtest: (configPath) => `webpack --config-test ${configPath}`,
    t: (configPath) => `webpack --config-test ${configPath}`,

    help: 'webpack --help',
    h: 'webpack --help',

    info: 'webpack-cli info',
    i: 'webpack-cli info',

    init: (genPath = '.') => `webpack-cli init ${genPath}`,
    create: (genPath = '.') => `webpack-cli init ${genPath}`,
    new: (genPath = '.') => `webpack-cli init ${genPath}`,
    c: (genPath = '.') => `webpack-cli init ${genPath}`,
    n: (genPath = '.') => `webpack-cli init ${genPath}`,

    loader: (outputPath) => `webpack-cli loader ${outputPath}`,
    l: (outputPath) => `webpack-cli loader ${outputPath}`,

    plugin: (outputPath) => `webpack-cli plugin ${outputPath}`,
    p: (outputPath) => `webpack-cli plugin ${outputPath}`,

    serve: 'webpack serve',
    server: 'webpack serve',
    s: 'webpack serve',

    version: 'webpack --version',
    v: 'webpack --version',

    watch: 'webpack --watch',
    w: 'webpack --watch',
};

// Map from argv to command
function parseArguments(argv) {
    let command = '';
    const args = [];
    
    argv.slice(2).forEach(arg => {
        if (arg.startsWith('-')) {
            args.push(arg);
        } else if (command === '') {
            command = arg;
        } else {
            args.push(arg);
        }
    });

    return { command, args };
}

// Main function to execute commands based on input
function main() {
    const { command, args } = parseArguments(process.argv);
    const commandFunc = commands[command] || commands['build'];
    let cmdStr;

    if (typeof commandFunc === 'function') {
        cmdStr = commandFunc(...args);
    } else {
        cmdStr = commandFunc;
    }

    try {
        const result = execSync(cmdStr, { stdio: 'inherit' });
        process.exit(0);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error executing command:', error.message);
        process.exit(1);
    }
}

// Run the main CLI processor
main();
```

This code snippet is a minimal Node.js package implementation that simulates the described `webpack CLI` functionality, supporting various commands and options as outlined in the README. It uses Node.js's `child_process.execSync` to run corresponding webpack commands, offering a high-level interface for interacting with webpack configurations and processes.

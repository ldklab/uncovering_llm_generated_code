The provided Node.js code defines a mocked ESLint plugin with configurations for recommended and all rules. It creates two rule sets: `recommendedRules` and `allRules`, with the latter including all recommended rules plus additional ones. These rule sets are then arranged into configurations and exported as part of the `jsPlugin` object.

Here is the possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
// file: index.js

// Define rule sets for ESLint configurations
const recommendedRules = {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "eqeqeq": "error",
    "curly": "error", 
    // Other rules can be added here
};

const allRules = {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "eqeqeq": "error",
    "curly": "error",
    "semi": "error",
    "no-console": "warn",
    // Additional rules can be added here
};

// ESLint plugin configuration
const jsPlugin = {
    configs: {
        recommended: {
            rules: recommendedRules
        },
        all: {
            rules: allRules
        }
    }
};

// Export the ESLint plugin
module.exports = jsPlugin;
```

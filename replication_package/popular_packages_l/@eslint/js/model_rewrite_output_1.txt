The Node.js code is creating and exporting a JavaScript plugin, specifically an ESLint configuration plugin. It defines mock ESLint configuration objects to simulate rule configurations. There are two sets of rule configurations: the `recommendedRules` contain a subset of rules that are considered essential or recommended, while `allRules` include all possible rules with additional ones like "semi" and "no-console". These configurations are structured under the `jsPlugin` object with two properties under `configs`: `recommended` and `all`, each containing their respective rules. Finally, the `jsPlugin` object is exported as a module.

Here's a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
// file: index.js

// Mock ESLint rule configurations for demonstration purposes
const rules = {
    recommended: {
        "no-unused-vars": "error",
        "eqeqeq": "error",
        "curly": "error",
    },
    all: {
        "no-unused-vars": "error",
        "eqeqeq": "error",
        "curly": "error",
        "semi": "error",
        "no-console": "warn",
    }
};

// Export the ESLint rules as a plugin with specific configurations
module.exports = {
    configs: {
        recommended: {
            rules: rules.recommended
        },
        all: {
            rules: rules.all
        }
    }
};
```

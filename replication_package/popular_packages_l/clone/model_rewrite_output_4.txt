The Node.js code utilizes the `clone` library to create a deep copy of an object. Here's a detailed explanation of how this works:

1. The `clone` library is required and used to make deep copies of JavaScript objects.

2. An object `a` is created with a nested structure: it has a property `foo` which itself is an object containing a property `bar` with the value `'baz'`.

3. The `clone()` function is called with `a` as the argument, creating a deep copy of `a` that is stored in the variable `b`. This means `b` has the same structure and values as `a`, but with any reference types (like nested objects) cloned instead of referenced.

4. The value of `a.foo.bar` is updated to `'foo'`.

5. The `console.log(a)` statement outputs the updated object `a`, which shows `foo: { bar: 'foo' }` since the `bar` property was modified.

6. The `console.log(b)` statement outputs the object `b`, which remains unchanged as `{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }` because `b` is a deep copy and is not affected by changes made to `a`.

Here is a rewrite of the original code using the JavaScript `structuredClone` method, which is natively available in modern JavaScript environments for deep cloning:

```javascript
var a = { foo: { bar: 'baz' } };
var b = structuredClone(a);
a.foo.bar = 'foo';
console.log(a); // { foo: { bar: 'foo' } }
console.log(b); // { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
```

The provided Node.js code uses the `clone` library to create a deep copy of an object. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. It imports the `clone` function from the `clone` library, which is used to create a deep copy of objects.
2. It defines an object `a` with a nested object structure `{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }`.
3. It uses the `clone` function to create a deep copy of `a`, assigning this new object to variable `b`.
4. It modifies the property `bar` of the nested object `foo` in `a` from `'baz'` to `'foo'`.
5. It logs object `a` to the console, showing the updated nested object `foo` with `bar` set to `'foo'`.
6. It logs object `b` to the console, which remains unchanged with the nested object `foo` retaining `bar` as `'baz'`, since `b` is a deep clone of `a` and independent of `a`'s subsequent changes.

Here's the rewritten code:

```javascript
const { cloneDeep } = require('lodash');
const a = { foo: { bar: 'baz' } };
const b = cloneDeep(a);
a.foo.bar = 'foo';
console.log(a); // { foo: { bar: 'foo' } }
console.log(b); // { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
```

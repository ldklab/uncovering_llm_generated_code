The functionality of this Node.js code is to demonstrate the creation of a deep clone of an object and how modifications to the original object do not affect the cloned object. 

1. The `clone` module is required to provide the functionality to deep clone an object.
2. An object `a` is created with nested properties.
3. The `clone` function is used to create a deep copy of the object `a`, stored in variable `b`.
4. The nested property `bar` of the original object `a` is modified.
5. `console.log` is used to display both the original and cloned objects. The logs illustrate that the original object `a` shows the updated value, while the clone `b` remains unchanged due to the deep clone.

Here's a possible rewrite of the original Node.js code:

```javascript
const cloneDeep = require('lodash.clonedeep');

const originalObject = { nested: { key: 'initial' } };
const clonedObject = cloneDeep(originalObject);

originalObject.nested.key = 'updated';

console.log(originalObject); // { nested: { key: 'updated' } }
console.log(clonedObject);  // { nested: { key: 'initial' } }
```

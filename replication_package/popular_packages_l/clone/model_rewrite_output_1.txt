The provided Node.js code utilizes the `clone` library to create a deep copy of an object. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **Importing the clone module**: The `clone` library is required at the start, enabling the use of its functionalities to clone objects.

2. **Creating an Object**: An object `a` is defined with a nested structure `{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }`.

3. **Cloning the Object**: Using the `clone` function, a deep copy of the object `a` is created and assigned to variable `b`. A deep copy ensures that all levels of nested objects are copied, rather than just duplicating the references at the outer level.

4. **Modifying the Original Object**: The property `bar` inside the nested object `foo` of `a` is changed from `'baz'` to `'foo'`.

5. **Logging the Objects**: The code logs both `a` and `b` to the console. 
   - `a` shows the updated nested object `{ foo: { bar: 'foo' } }`.
   - `b`, however, remains unchanged as `{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }` because `b` is a deep clone of the original `a`.

Rewritten Code:

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const original = { foo: { bar: 'baz' } };
const deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(original);

original.foo.bar = 'foo';

console.log(original); // { foo: { bar: 'foo' } }
console.log(deepCopy); // { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
```

This rewritten code uses Lodash's `cloneDeep` function to achieve the same deep cloning functionality as the original with `clone`. The rest of the code remains largely unchanged, reflecting the same object structure and modifications.

The `for-each` package is a utility module that extends the functionality of the native `Array.prototype.forEach` method to work not only with arrays, but also with objects. This means that you can use it to iterate over the properties of an object in addition to iterating over elements in an array. The function iterates over each property of an object or each element of an array, executing a provided callback function for each one. 

When called with an object, the callback function receives the value of the property as the first argument, the key of the property as the second argument, and the entire object as the third argument. When called with an array, the callback function receives the array element value as the first argument, the index of the element as the second argument, and the entire array as the third argument.

Here's the implementation code for such a `for-each` Node.js package:

```markdown
// for-each.js
module.exports = function forEach(collection, callback) {
  if (Array.isArray(collection)) {
    // Array case
    for (let i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
      callback(collection[i], i, collection);
    }
  } else if (collection !== null && typeof collection === 'object') {
    // Object case
    for (const key in collection) {
      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(collection, key)) {
        callback(collection[key], key, collection);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```markdown
// package.json
{
  "name": "for-each",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A better forEach for arrays and objects.",
  "main": "for-each.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "author": "Raynos",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

```markdown
// test.js
const forEach = require('./for-each');

// Test with an object
forEach({ key: "value", anotherKey: "anotherValue" }, function (value, key, object) {
  console.log(key + ": " + value);
});

// Test with an array
forEach([1, 2, 3], function (value, index, array) {
  console.log(index + ": " + value);
});
```

To install this package, you would create these files in a directory, and run `npm install` inside that directory to initialize a new Node.js package. The `for-each.js` file contains the main functionality, `package.json` defines the package, and `test.js` is a simple script to test the functionality.

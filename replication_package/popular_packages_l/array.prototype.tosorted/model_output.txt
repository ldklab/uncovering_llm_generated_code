The Node.js package `array.prototype.tosorted` is a shim/polyfill for the `Array.prototype.toSorted` function proposed in ESnext (a future version of ECMAScript). This function is used to create a sorted copy of an array without modifying the original array. The package offers a way to utilize this upcoming feature in environments that do not yet support it natively, going as far back as ES3 environments.

Hereâ€™s what the package does:

1. **Main Functionality**: It provides a function that sorts a given array and returns a new array with the sorted elements, while preserving the original array unchanged.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Despite its reliance on potentially unsupported native methods (due to how new the feature might be), it acts as a polyfill or shim that allows the function to be used in older JavaScript environments.
3. **Shim Usage**: It can be added to the `Array.prototype` object using the `shim()` method, patching any environment that lacks native support for `Array.prototype.toSorted`.
4. **Testing**: It provides tests to ensure that the polyfill is functioning identically to the upcoming specification and covers cases where the native method does or does not exist.

Here's how the implementation could look like:

```javascript
// array.prototype.tosorted.js
function toSorted(array, compareFn) {
    if (!Array.isArray(array)) {
        throw new TypeError('The provided value is not an Array');
    }
    const copy = array.slice(); // Create a shallow copy of the array
    return copy.sort(compareFn); // Sort the copy and return it
}

function getPolyfill() {
    return typeof Array.prototype.toSorted === 'function' ? Array.prototype.toSorted : toSorted;
}

function shim() {
    if (typeof Array.prototype.toSorted !== 'function') {
        Array.prototype.toSorted = function(compareFn) {
            return toSorted(this, compareFn);
        };
    }
    return Array.prototype.toSorted;
}

module.exports = {
    toSorted: toSorted,
    getPolyfill: getPolyfill,
    shim: shim
};
```

To use the above shim in your code, after installation, you can call `require('array.prototype.tosorted').shim()` and start using `Array.prototype.toSorted` as illustrated in the examples in the README. The provided methods ensure that the feature is both available and behaves according to the ESnext specification as closely as possible.

The functionality of the `pino` package, as described in the README.md, is to provide a very low overhead logging library for Node.js applications. It emphasizes efficiency by minimizing resource usage, which is particularly important in maintaining the performance of applications over time as log messages accumulate. The key features and functionalities of `pino` can be summarized as follows:

1. **Basic Logging**: The package provides simple logging functionalities. By default, the logger outputs log messages in JSON format, which includes fields such as `level` (severity level of the log), `time` (timestamp when the log is generated), `msg` (log message), `pid` (process ID), and `hostname`.

2. **Child Loggers**: It supports the creation of child loggers which inherit settings from the parent logger but can also introduce additional properties to log messages. This is useful for managing context-specific logging in different parts of an application or module.

3. **Development Formatting**: For easier readability of logs during development, `pino` can be used in conjunction with `pino-pretty`, a module that formats logs in a more human-readable way.

4. **Transports**: Pino introduces the concept of "transports," which are separate processes or threads responsible for handling log processing tasks such as sending logs to external systems or further formatting. This is crucial for maintaining the performance of Node.js applications by preventing logging operations from blocking the event loop.

5. **Performance**: It claims to be significantly faster than many alternative logging libraries, thereby making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

6. **Bundling Support**: Pino supports bundling with build tools like webpack or esbuild, allowing it to be included in modern JavaScript builds efficiently.

7. **Installation**: It can be installed using either npm or yarn package managers.

Below is a basic implementation of the `pino` functionality focusing on the core described features:

```js
// pino.js - A basic implementation of Pino logging

const os = require('os');

function createLogger() {
  // Base logger object with default properties
  const baseLogger = {
    level: 30, // Info level
    pid: process.pid,
    hostname: os.hostname(),
  };

  // Basic log function
  function log(level, message, additionalProps = {}) {
    const logObject = {
      ...baseLogger,
      level,
      time: Date.now(),
      msg: message,
      ...additionalProps,
    };
    console.log(JSON.stringify(logObject));
  }

  // API to log info level messages
  function info(message) {
    log(30, message);
  }

  // Method to generate child loggers
  function child(childProps) {
    return createChildLogger(childProps);
  }

  // Factory function to create child logger with additional properties
  function createChildLogger(childProps) {
    return {
      info: (message) => log(30, message, childProps),
    };
  }

  return {
    info,
    child,
  };
}

// Usage example
const logger = createLogger();
logger.info('hello world');

const child = logger.child({ a: 'property' });
child.info('hello child!');

// Exporting createLogger for external use
module.exports = createLogger;
```

This code provides a simple yet effective logging utility mimicking the `pino` package's functionality, with a focus on performance by using JSON serialization for logs and supporting child loggers through a closure-based design.

The `cross-env` package for Node.js is designed to handle environment variables in a way that works across different platforms. It addresses the issue where Windows and POSIX systems handle environment variables differently. For example, setting an environment variable in a script like `NODE_ENV=production` works in UNIX-like systems but not in Windows command prompts.

Here’s how `cross-env` solves this:

1. **Single Command Interface**: `cross-env` provides a way to use a single command syntax that sets and uses environment variables appropriately across different operating systems. This standardizes scripting environments, particularly in `npm` scripts, to ensure predictable behavior.

2. **Usage**:
   - To install, it’s included as a dev dependency via npm.
   - Scripts in `package.json` can then wrap commands with `cross-env` to handle setting environment variables uniformly.
   - It supports executing commands by setting multiple environment variables as part of the script.

3. **Two Binaries**: `cross-env` exposes two command-line binaries:
   - `cross-env`: Executes commands using cross-platform tools.
   - `cross-env-shell`: Utilizes shell capabilities to handle inline shell scripting, useful when working with shell features or needing to set env variables for multiple commands.

4. **Windows Considerations**: This package also offers strategies to deal with Windows peculiarities, such as modifying `.npmrc` for improved shell support using tools like PowerShell.

5. **Special Features**:
   - It allows the use of typical POSIX style for environment variables even on Windows, which normally uses a different syntax.
   - Supports escaping syntax where required in JSON configuration to make it compatible across systems.

Here's a sample implementation of `cross-env`:

```javascript
// cross-env.js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const path = require('path');

function parseEnvVar(envVar) {
  const [key, ...valParts] = envVar.split('=');
  const value = valParts.join('=');
  return [key, value];
}

function getEnvVariables(envVars) {
  return envVars.reduce((env, envVar) => {
    const [key, value] = parseEnvVar(envVar);
    if (key) env[key] = value;
    return env;
  }, Object.assign({}, process.env));
}

function crossEnv(args) {
  const envVars = [];
  const commandArgs = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    if (args[i].includes('=')) {
      envVars.push(args[i]);
    } else {
      commandArgs.push(args[i]);
    }
  }

  const command = commandArgs[0];
  const cmdArgs = commandArgs.slice(1);
  const env = getEnvVariables(envVars);

  return spawn(command, cmdArgs, {
    stdio: 'inherit',
    shell: true,
    env,
  }).on('exit', process.exit);
}

module.exports = { crossEnv };

if (require.main === module) {
  crossEnv(process.argv.slice(2));
}
```

This code provides the basic mechanics of `cross-env`, allowing environment variable declaration that is then passed down to subsequent processes. When executed, it ensures the timing and inclusion of environment variables behave uniformly across different operating systems, accommodating both UNIX-like and Windows systems syntax.

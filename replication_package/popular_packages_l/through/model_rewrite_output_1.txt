The provided Node.js code defines a function called `through` that is used to create a custom stream. This custom stream acts as a passthrough stream, allowing data to be written into it and emitted downstream, while also handling "end" events and supporting pausing and resuming of data flow. Here's an explanation of its primary components:

1. **Write Function**: By default, it simply queues the incoming data to be emitted. It can be customized by passing a function to modify data before it's queued.

2. **End Function**: By default, it queues a `null` value, indicating the end of data. It can be customized to perform additional operations before ending the stream.

3. **Stream**: An instance of Node.js's `Stream` that is both readable and writable, initialized with properties to handle data flow control, such as `paused`.

4. **Methods**:
   - `write`: Takes data, processes it with the custom write function, and ensures the stream is not paused before returning.
   - `queue`: Emits data or signifies the end by emitting 'end'.
   - `end`: Accepts data, writes it if provided, and then calls the end function.
   - `pause` and `resume`: Manage the stream's paused state.
   - `autoDestroy`: Determines if the stream should destroy itself after emitting 'end'.

5. **Event Handling**: The stream listens for 'end' and, if `autoDestroy` is enabled, it will also emit a 'close' event to clean up the stream's resources.

Here's a possible rewrite of the given Node.js code:

```javascript
const { Stream } = require('stream');

function through(writeFunction, endFunction, options) {
  const defaultWrite = function(data) { this.queue(data); };
  const defaultEnd = function() { this.queue(null); };
  
  const stream = new Stream();
  stream.readable = true;
  stream.writable = true;
  stream.paused = false;
  
  stream.write = function(data) {
    (writeFunction || defaultWrite).call(this, data);
    return !stream.paused;
  };

  stream.queue = function(data) {
    if (data === null) {
      return stream.emit('end');
    }
    return stream.emit('data', data);
  };

  stream.end = function(data) {
    if (arguments.length) this.write(data);
    (endFunction || defaultEnd).call(this);
    return this;
  };

  stream.pause = function() {
    if (!this.paused) {
      this.paused = true;
      this.emit('pause');
    }
  };

  stream.resume = function() {
    if (this.paused) {
      this.paused = false;
      this.emit('resume');
    }
  };

  stream.autoDestroy = !(options && options.autoDestroy === false);

  if (stream.autoDestroy) {
    stream.on('end', function() {
      process.nextTick(() => {
        if (stream.readable && stream.writable) {
          stream.readable = stream.writable = false;
          stream.emit('close');
        }
      });
    });
  }

  return stream;
}

module.exports = through;
```

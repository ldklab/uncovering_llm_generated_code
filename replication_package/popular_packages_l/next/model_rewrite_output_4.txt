```javascript
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Define a simple React component
  const App = () => React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, Next.js inspired framework!');
  // Convert the component into a string
  const appString = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(React.createElement(App));

  // Embed the rendered HTML into a basic HTML document
  const html = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Simple Next.js Inspired Framework</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${appString}</div>
      </body>
    </html>
  `;

  // Send the HTML as the response
  res.send(html);
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

```javascript
// build.js
console.log('Building application...');
// This file is a placeholder indicating where build logic could be added.
```

This rewritten code accomplishes the following:

- **package.json**: Declares a Node.js project with necessary dependencies (`express`, `react`, and `react-dom`) and scripts to start the server and a placeholder build command.
  
- **index.js**: Implements an Express server that responds to requests on the root endpoint. When a GET request is made to the root, it renders a simple React component to a string and embeds it within an HTML template that gets sent as the response.

- **build.js**: Logs a message indicating it's a placeholder for future build logic which would involve compiling the React components. 

Overall, this setup mimics a simplified framework inspired by Next.js, focusing primarily on using server-side rendering with React in an Express server.

The given Node.js code defines a class `Address6` that models an IPv6 address and encapsulates various operations related to such addresses. Key functionalities of this code include:

- **Construction and Initialization**: The `Address6` class accepts a string representing an IPv6 address and attempts to gather Teredo-related information through a stub `inspectTeredo` method, which is not correctly implemented and returns a hardcoded result.

- **Extraction from URLs**: A static method `fromURL` extracts an IPv6 address from a given URL string that includes the address within square brackets, matching common representation styles of IPv6 addresses in URLs.

- **Conversion Methods**: The stub methods `toHex`, `toBinary`, and `toDecimal` suggest plans for converting the address into various display formats but lack actual implementations.

- **Subnet and Property Checks**: The methods `isValidSubnet` and `hasSpecialProperties` are placeholders for functionalities that would evaluate network properties of the address.

- **Example Usage and Export**: The script includes example usage of the class and demonstrates how the address is used to call its Teredo-inspection method. It also handles module exports in both CommonJS and AMD formats.

Here is the rewritten code that follows the same explanation, considering simplification and clarity:

```javascript
// ip-address.js
class Address6 {
  constructor(address) {
    this.address = address;
    this.teredoInfo = this.inspectTeredo();
  }
  
  static fromURL(url) {
    const ipv6Pattern = /\[([^\]]+)\]/;
    const match = url.match(ipv6Pattern);
    if (match) {
      return new Address6(match[1]);
    }
    throw new Error("No IPv6 address found in URL");
  }

  inspectTeredo() {
    // Simplified placeholder for Teredo inspection logic
    return {
      client4: '192.0.0.2' // Example hardcoded value
    };
  }

  toHex() {
    // Placeholder for conversion to hexadecimal format
  }

  toBinary() {
    // Placeholder for conversion to binary format
  }

  toDecimal() {
    // Placeholder for conversion to decimal
  }

  isValidSubnet(otherAddress) {
    // Placeholder for subnet validity check
  }

  hasSpecialProperties() {
    // Placeholder for checking special address properties
  }
}

// Example usage
const exampleAddress = new Address6('2001:0:ce49:7601:e866:efff:62c3:fffe');
const teredoInfo = exampleAddress.inspectTeredo();
console.log("Teredo client IPv4 address:", teredoInfo.client4);

// Export module
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
  module.exports = {
    Address6,
  };
} else if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
  define([], function() {
    return {
      Address6,
    };
  });
}
```

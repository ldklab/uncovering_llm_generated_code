The functionality described in the `babel-jest` package's README.md is for integrating Babel with Jest, which is a popular testing framework. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features and syntax. The `babel-jest` package acts as a Jest transformer, enabling Jest to understand and compile your JavaScript code using Babel before running tests. This means you don't have to directly modify your source code for testing because `babel-jest` automatically processes the code.

Key functionalities explained are:
1. **Automatic Installation and Usage**: By simply adding the `babel-jest` package in a project using Jest, it automatically compiles the JavaScript code using Babel. This allows developers to write JavaScript with modern syntax while ensuring compatibility when testing with Jest.

2. **Custom Preprocessor**: If developers prefer, they can write their own code preprocessor instead of using `babel-jest`. This involves setting the Jest configuration to use the custom preprocessor instead of `babel-jest`.

3. **Configuration for Transforming Files**: If `babel-jest` is used alongside other code preprocessors, explicit configuration is needed to define `babel-jest` as the transformer for JavaScript and TypeScript files. This is done by mapping file patterns like `\\.jsx?$` and `\\.tsx?$` to `babel-jest` in the Jest `transform` configuration option.

Overall, `babel-jest` simplifies the setup for running tests on modern JavaScript (and TypeScript) code by leveraging Babel to handle syntax transformation, ensuring code is testable in environments not natively supporting modern syntax.

Here's an example implementation:

```js
// package.json
{
  "name": "babel-jest-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.0.0",
    "babel-jest": "^26.6.0",
    "jest": "^26.6.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "jest": {
    "transform": {
      "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest"
    }
  },
  "babel": {
    "presets": [
      [
        "@babel/preset-env",
        {
          "targets": {
            "node": "current"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}

// Example test file: sum.test.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

test('sums two numbers', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});

// Run `yarn test` to execute tests
```

This code specifies the Node.js package configuration using `package.json`, sets up Babel with the Jest testing framework, and automatically compiles and tests JavaScript files with Babel through `babel-jest`. The configuration supports both JavaScript and TypeScript files with the `transform` key in Jest's configuration.

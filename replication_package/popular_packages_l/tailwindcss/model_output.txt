The functionality described in the README.md is for the Tailwind CSS project, which is a utility-first CSS framework designed to help with building custom user interfaces rapidly. The README provides information on various aspects such as accessing full documentation, ways to engage with the community, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

**Key Features:**
1. **Utility-First Framework**: Tailwind CSS focuses on offering utility classes to build designs directly from the HTML, allowing for rapid design prototyping without writing custom CSS.

2. **Documentation**: The README directs users to the Tailwind CSS website for comprehensive documentation.

3. **Community Support**: Users can participate in discussions on GitHub for help and best practices. There is also a Discord server for more casual interaction with other users.

4. **Contributing Guidelines**: For contributing to Tailwind CSS, guidelines are provided to help potential contributors understand how to make contributions effectively.

Below is the code for a mock Node.js package that provides similar utility-first CSS framework functionalities described above. Since implementing a comprehensive CSS framework like Tailwind is quite extensive, this mock package implementation will focus on the structure and basic functioning to illustrate the concept.

```javascript
// index.js

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const utilities = {
  'text-center': 'text-align: center;',
  'font-bold': 'font-weight: bold;',
  'mt-4': 'margin-top: 1rem;',
  'p-2': 'padding: 0.5rem;',
  // Add more utility classes as needed
};

function applyUtilityClasses(classes) {
  const classList = classes.split(' ');
  let styles = '';
  classList.forEach(cls => {
    if (utilities[cls]) {
      styles += utilities[cls];
    }
  });
  return styles;
}

function generateCSS(inputHTML, outputCSS) {
  const regex = /class="([^"]+)"/g;
  let match;
  let styles = '';

  while ((match = regex.exec(inputHTML)) !== null) {
    styles += applyUtilityClasses(match[1]) + '\n';
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(outputCSS, styles);
  console.log(`Generated CSS saved to ${outputCSS}`);
}

function readHTML(filePath) {
  return fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
}

// Command-line interface
const args = process.argv.slice(2);

if (args.length < 2) {
  console.error("Usage: node index.js <input.html> <output.css>");
  process.exit(1);
}

const inputHTMLPath = path.resolve(args[0]);
const outputCSSPath = path.resolve(args[1]);

const htmlContent = readHTML(inputHTMLPath);
generateCSS(htmlContent, outputCSSPath);
```

This script:
- Defines a small set of mock utility classes with associated styles.
- Provides a function to translate these classes into CSS styles.
- Reads an HTML file, extracts `class` attributes, converts them to CSS styles, and writes them to an output CSS file.
- Offers a basic command-line interface for running the generation script with input HTML and output CSS file paths.

The Node.js code provided is a simple React-Redux application. It comprises several integral parts typically found in such applications:

1. **Initial State**: The application starts with an initial state containing a `count` field initialized to 0.

2. **Reducer**: A reducer function (`counterReducer`) manages state changes. It listens for specific action types (`INCREMENT`, `DECREMENT`) and returns new state objects based on these actions. 

3. **Store**: Using the defined reducer, a Redux store is created which holds the entire state of the application.

4. **React Component**: `Counter` is a React component that displays the current count and has buttons for incrementing and decrementing the count.

5. **Mapping State and Dispatch to Props**: The `connect` function is used to connect the `Counter` component to the Redux store. 
   - `mapStateToProps` selects the part of data from the store that the `Counter` component needs.
   - `mapDispatchToProps` provides methods for the UI to dispatch actions (`INCREMENT`, `DECREMENT`) to the Redux store.

6. **Provider and Rendering**: The `Provider` component wraps the entire application, giving all components access to the Redux store. Finally, the `ConnectedCounter` component is rendered to the DOM.

Here is a rewritten version of the code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const { createStore } = require('redux');
const React = require('react');
const ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
const { Provider, connect } = require('react-redux');

// Initial state setup
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Reducer function to handle state changes
const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

// Create Redux store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// React Component to display counter and buttons
const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
    <div>
        <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
);

// Connect Redux state and dispatch to component props
const mapStateToProps = state => ({ count: state.count });
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
    decrement: () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
});

// Connecting the component
const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

// Render application with Redux Provider
ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <ConnectedCounter />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

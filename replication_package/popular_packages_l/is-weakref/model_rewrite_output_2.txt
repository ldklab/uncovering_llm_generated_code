The Node.js code defines a function named `isWeakRef` which checks if a given value is a `WeakRef` instance. This function first ensures that the value is an object since `WeakRef` can only be an object. It then checks if `WeakRef` is available in the current environment and if the object is indeed an instance of `WeakRef`. As a fallback for other contexts that might not properly handle `WeakRef` instances due to cross-realm issues, it uses `Object.prototype.toString.call()` to reliably check the internal class of the object as a string comparison.

Here is the rewritten code:

```javascript
// is-weakref.js
'use strict';

function isWeakRef(value) {
  // Ensure the input is an object and WeakRef is defined
  if (typeof WeakRef !== 'undefined' && value instanceof WeakRef) {
    return true;
  }

  // Fallback for environments with potential realm issues
  return Object(value) === value && Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object WeakRef]';
}

module.exports = isWeakRef;
```

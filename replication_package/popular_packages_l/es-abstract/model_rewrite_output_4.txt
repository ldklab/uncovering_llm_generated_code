The given Node.js code utilizes the `es-abstract` package to check if a given input is callable (i.e., if it is a function that can be called). The `isCallable` method is used to determine this. The script includes assertions using Node.js's built-in `assert` module to verify the correctness of this check:

1. It uses the `isCallable` method on an anonymous function `function () {}` which should return `true` because a function is always callable.
2. It uses the `isCallable` method on a regular expression `/a/g` which should return `false` because a regular expression is not callable.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const { isCallable } = require('es-abstract');
const assert = require('assert');

// Check if a regular function is callable
assert(isCallable(() => {})); // should return true as arrow functions are callable

// Check if a regular expression is callable
assert(!isCallable(/a/g)); // should return false as regexp objects are not callable
```

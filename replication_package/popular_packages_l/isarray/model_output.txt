The `isarray` Node.js package provides a function to determine if a given value is an array. It serves as a polyfill for the `Array.isArray` method, which may not be available in older browsers or deprecated versions of Node.js. This package is essentially a compatibility utility to ensure that the `Array.isArray` function can be used universally across different JavaScript environments.

The primary functionality of the package is a single exported function that checks if the input value is an array and returns `true` if it is, or `false` otherwise. This replicates the behavior of the native `Array.isArray` method.

Below is the implementation of this functionality in a Node.js package:

```javascript
// isarray.js
function isArray(value) {
  return Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Array]';
}

module.exports = isArray;
```

To use this function in a Node.js application, you would require the module and utilize it as shown in the usage example:

```javascript
// usage-example.js
var isArray = require('./isarray');

console.log(isArray([])); // => true
console.log(isArray({})); // => false
```

To install it as a package via npm (assuming it is published), you would run:

```bash
$ npm install isarray
```

For browser support, you could bundle it using a tool like browserify.

The package also includes badges indicating build status and download statistics, and requests for sponsorship or donations to support further development. However, these are for informational and community support purposes rather than part of the package's functionality itself.

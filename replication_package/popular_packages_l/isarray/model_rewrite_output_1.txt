The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to define and export a function called `isArray`. This function checks if a given value is an array. It does so by using the `Object.prototype.toString.call()` method, which returns a string representation of the `value`'s internal [[Class]], and then compares it to the string `"[object Array]"`. If the comparison is true, the value is an array; otherwise, it is not.

Below is a rewritten version of the provided code:

```javascript
// isarray.js
const isArray = (value) => Array.isArray(value);

module.exports = isArray;
```

In this version, the code leverages the built-in `Array.isArray()` method, which is a more direct and modern way to determine if a value is an array. The functionality remains the same, checking if a given value is an array, but with a cleaner and more concise implementation.

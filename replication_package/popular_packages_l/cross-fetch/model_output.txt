The `cross-fetch` package is designed to provide a universal interface for the Fetch API, making it usable across different JavaScript environments such as Node.js, browsers, and React Native. Its primary objective is to ensure that the same codebase can seamlessly work in these various platforms using a consistent and WHATWG-compliant Fetch API. Key features of this package include:

1. **Platform Agnostic**: It functions on multiple platforms including browsers, Node.js, and React Native without requiring extensive configuration or dependencies.

2. **Optional Polyfill**: Users can choose to either use it as a ponyfill (imported locally, without affecting the global space) or as a polyfill (modifies global objects to include the fetch function).

3. **Simple Interface**: It eliminates the need for complex instantiation or configuration, providing a straightforward method to utilize the Fetch API.

4. **WHATWG Compliance**: Ensures consistency in how the Fetch API works across different environments.

5. **TypeScript Support**: Enhances the development experience by providing support for TypeScript, ensuring better type-checking and error detection.

6. **Worker Support**: Compatible with various worker environments, such as Service Workers and CloudFlare Workers, expanding its utility in web applications.

To use the package, it can be installed via npm and imported either as a module (ponyfill) or as a global polyfill. It can be used for network requests with JavaScript’s promise-based approach or with async/await, offering flexibility in handling asynchronous code.

Below is the code for a basic implementation of the `cross-fetch` package:

```javascript
// cross-fetch.js
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');

let fetchFunc;

if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.fetch) {
  // In a browser environment, use the native fetch
  fetchFunc = window.fetch.bind(window);
} else if (typeof self !== 'undefined' && self.fetch) {
  // In a worker environment, use the worker's fetch
  fetchFunc = self.fetch.bind(self);
} else {
  // In Node.js environment, use the node-fetch library
  fetchFunc = nodeFetch;
}

module.exports = fetchFunc;
```

```javascript
// polyfill.js
if (typeof globalThis.fetch !== 'function') {
  globalThis.fetch = require('./cross-fetch');
}
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "cross-fetch",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Universal WHATWG Fetch API for Node, Browsers, Workers and React Native",
  "main": "cross-fetch.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"No test specified\" && exit 0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "node-fetch": "^2.6.1"
  },
  "author": "Leonardo Quixadá",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

```javascript
// Usage Example

// Using the fetch function from cross-fetch
const fetch = require('./cross-fetch');

// Fetch data from API
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));

// Using the polyfill import
require('./polyfill');
fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));
```

This module can be utilized by importing it into your JavaScript projects, allowing you to make network requests using a consistent API in different environments. The `cross-fetch` implementation checks the running context (i.e., browser, worker, Node.js) and provides the appropriate fetch function accordingly, either native or from the `node-fetch` package. The option to use `polyfill.js` allows you to add the fetch function to the global context, mimicking a polyfill approach.

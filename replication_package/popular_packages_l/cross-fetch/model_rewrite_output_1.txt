The given Node.js code is a module that determines the appropriate `fetch` function to use depending on the execution environment. It checks:

1. If it is running in a browser environment by verifying if `window` is defined and whether `fetch` is a method on `window`. If true, it binds and uses the `fetch` function from the browser's global `window` object.

2. If it is running in a web worker environment by checking the existence of `self` and `fetch` on `self`. If this condition is true, it binds and uses the `fetch` function from the worker's global `self` object.

3. If it is neither a browser nor a worker environment (assumed to be a Node.js environment), it uses the `node-fetch` library, which is a `fetch` implementation for Node.js.

It then exports the selected `fetch` function so that it can be used in other parts of the application.

```javascript
// cross-fetch.js

const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');

const fetchFunc = (() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.fetch === 'function') {
    // In a browser environment, use the native fetch
    return window.fetch.bind(window);
  } 
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined' && typeof self.fetch === 'function') {
    // In a worker environment, use the worker's fetch
    return self.fetch.bind(self);
  }
  // In Node.js environment, use the node-fetch library
  return nodeFetch;
})();

module.exports = fetchFunc;
```

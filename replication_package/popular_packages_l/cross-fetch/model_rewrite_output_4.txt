The provided Node.js code is a module that exports a `fetch` function which works seamlessly across different JavaScript environments: browsers, web workers, and Node.js. The code checks the environment and assigns the appropriate `fetch` implementation:

1. If in a browser environment (`window` is defined and `window.fetch` is available), it uses the native `fetch` function available on the `window` object.
2. If in a web worker environment (`self` is defined and `self.fetch` is available), it uses the `fetch` function available in the worker.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it assumes a Node.js environment and uses the `fetch` implementation provided by the `node-fetch` library.

Below is a rewritten version of the original code:

```javascript
// cross-fetch.js
const nodeFetch = require('node-fetch');

const fetchFunc = 
  (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.fetch) ? window.fetch.bind(window) :
  (typeof self !== 'undefined' && self.fetch) ? self.fetch.bind(self) :
  nodeFetch;

module.exports = fetchFunc;
```

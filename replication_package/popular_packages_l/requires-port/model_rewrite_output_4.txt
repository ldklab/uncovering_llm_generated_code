The Node.js code provided is a command to install a package from the npm registry and save it as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file. The package being installed is called `requires-port`.

Here's a breakdown of what this command does:

- `npm install` is the command used to install packages from the npm registry.
- The `--save` flag indicates that the package should be added to the dependencies section of your project's `package.json` file. This flag is now redundant in newer versions of npm, as saving to dependencies is the default behavior.
- `requires-port` is the name of the npm package that is being installed. This package checks if a protocol requires a port to be explicitly specified.

A possible rewrite of this code, given the understanding of its behavior and considering modern npm defaults, is as follows:

```bash
npm install requires-port
```

The Node.js code is a command meant to be executed in the terminal. It uses the Node Package Manager (`npm`) to install a package called `requires-port` and save it as a dependency in the project's `package.json` file. The `--save` flag is used to add the package to the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file, which is important for ensuring that anyone else working on the project installs the same dependencies.

Rewritten version:

```sh
npm install requires-port --save
```

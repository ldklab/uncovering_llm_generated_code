The functionality of the Node.js code `npm install --save requires-port` is to install a specific npm package called `requires-port` and add it to the list of dependencies in the project's `package.json` file. The `requires-port` package is typically used to determine if a given port is required for a particular protocol in a URL. By using the flag `--save`, the installed package gets recorded under the `dependencies` field in the `package.json` file, ensuring that it is included when the project is shared or deployed.

Here is a rewritten version of the command in the context of a code block:

# To achieve the same functionality as `npm install --save requires-port`, you can use the following rewritten command:

# Use npm install with the --save flag to install the 'requires-port' package and save it as a dependency in package.json

npm i requires-port --save
```

The given Node.js code is a command to install a package called `requires-port` using `npm`, which is the Node.js package manager. The `--save` flag indicates that the installed package should be added to the dependencies list in the `package.json` file, which is used to manage the project's dependencies.

The purpose of the `requires-port` package is likely to check if certain protocols require a port number in the URL, though without more context or the actual package documentation, this is an assumption based on the package's name.

Here's a possible rewrite of the code using a more modern approach that includes using `npm install` without the `--save` flag, as dependency management is automatically handled by default in recent versions of `npm`:

```bash
npm install requires-port
```

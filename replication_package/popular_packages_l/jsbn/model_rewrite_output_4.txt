The given Node.js code utilizes the `jsbn` library to handle big integers beyond JavaScript's native number limit. The process involves creating a `BigInteger` object from a large numerical string, and then calculating the bit length of this integer, which is the number of bits necessary to represent the integer in binary form. Finally, the code logs the bit length to the console.

Here is a rewritten version of the code:

```javascript
const { BigInteger } = require('jsbn');

const bigInt = new BigInteger('91823918239182398123');

const bitLength = bigInt.bitLength();

console.log(`The bit length of the big integer is: ${bitLength}`);
```

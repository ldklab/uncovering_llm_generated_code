The given Node.js code performs the following functions:

1. **Imports the jsbn Library**: The `jsbn` library is imported to handle big integer operations in JavaScript, which aren't supported natively.

2. **Creates a Big Integer Instance**: A new BigInteger object is created with the string representation of a large number, `91823918239182398123`.

3. **Calculates and Logs the Bit Length**: The `bitLength()` method is called on the BigInteger instance to compute the number of bits used by this big integer, effectively determining how large the number is in terms of binary digits. This bit length is then printed to the console.

Below is a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
const { BigInteger } = require('jsbn');

const bigNumber = new BigInteger('91823918239182398123');
const bitLength = bigNumber.bitLength();

console.log(bitLength); // Logs the bit length of the big integer
```

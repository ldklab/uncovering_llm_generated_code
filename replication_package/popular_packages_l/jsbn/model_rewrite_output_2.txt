The Node.js code provided uses the 'jsbn' library to work with large integers. It specifically creates an instance of a `BigInteger` with a large numeric string '91823918239182398123'. The code then calculates and logs the bit length of this big integer to the console, which is the number of bits required to represent the number in binary form. 

Here's a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const { BigInteger } = require('jsbn');

// Create a BigInteger instance with a large number
const bigIntNumber = new BigInteger('91823918239182398123');

// Calculate and log the bit length of the big integer
const bitLengthOfBigInt = bigIntNumber.bitLength();
console.log(bitLengthOfBigInt); // Outputs the bit length
```

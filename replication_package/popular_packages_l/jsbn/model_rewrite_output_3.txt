The given Node.js code is using the `jsbn` library to work with big integers. Here's a breakdown of the code's functionality:

1. Import the `BigInteger` class from the `jsbn` library.
2. Create an instance of `BigInteger` with a large integer value represented as a string ('91823918239182398123').
3. Call the `bitLength()` method on this instance to calculate and output the bit length of the big integer. The bit length is the number of bits required to represent the number in binary.

Here's a possible rewrite of this code:

```javascript
// Import the BigInteger class from the jsbn library
const { BigInteger } = require('jsbn');

// Create a BigInteger instance with a specified large integer
const bigIntValue = new BigInteger('91823918239182398123');

// Get the bit length of the big integer and log it to the console
const bitLength = bigIntValue.bitLength();
console.log(bitLength); // Outputs the bit length of the big integer
```

The provided Node.js code utilizes the `deep-equal` library to perform deep comparison between two objects. The `equal` function checks whether the two objects are equivalent in terms of their structure and values. In this code:

1. `equal({ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }, { a: [2, 3], b: [4] })` compares two identical objects with arrays as values, which results in `true` because their structure and contents are equal.

2. `equal({ x: 5, y: [6] }, { x: 5, y: 6 })` compares two objects, where one has an array and the other a number for the same key `y`, resulting in `false` because the value types and structures differ.

Finally, the results of these comparisons, `[true, false]`, are printed to the console using `console.dir`.

Here's the rewritten code with the same functionality:

```javascript
const deepEqual = require('deep-equal'); // Import the deep-equal library

// Perform deep comparisons between two sets of objects
const results = [
    deepEqual({ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }, { a: [2, 3], b: [4] }), // Expect true: both objects are identical
    deepEqual({ x: 5, y: [6] }, { x: 5, y: 6 }) // Expect false: different structures for y
];

// Output the comparison results to the console
console.log(results);
```

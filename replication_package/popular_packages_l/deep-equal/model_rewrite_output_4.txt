The functionality of the provided Node.js code is to compare two pairs of JavaScript objects for deep equality using the `deep-equal` library. 

1. The `deep-equal` library is imported and used to deeply compare two JavaScript objects to check if they are equivalent in structure and data.
2. Two comparisons are made:
   - The first comparison checks if the objects `{ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }` and `{ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }` are deeply equal, which they are, so it returns `true`.
   - The second comparison checks if the objects `{ x: 5, y: [6] }` and `{ x: 5, y: 6 }` are deeply equal, which they are not (due to the difference between an array and a number), so it returns `false`.
3. The results of these comparisons are logged to the console.

Below is a possible rewrite of the given code:

```javascript
const deepEqual = require('deep-equal');

const objectComparisonResults = [
    deepEqual({ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }, { a: [2, 3], b: [4] }),   // true
    deepEqual({ x: 5, y: [6] }, { x: 5, y: 6 })               // false
];

console.dir(objectComparisonResults);
```

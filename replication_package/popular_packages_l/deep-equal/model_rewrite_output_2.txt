The given Node.js code imports the `deep-equal` library, which provides a function to perform deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent. The code then uses the `equal` function to compare two pairs of objects for equivalence, and logs the results to the console in an array format. The comparisons made are:

1. Comparing two identical objects `{ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }` and `{ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }`, which evaluates to `true` since both objects have the same structure and content.
2. Comparing the objects `{ x: 5, y: [6] }` and `{ x: 5, y: 6 }`, which evaluates to `false` because the structure of the `y` property differs (one is an array while the other is a number).

Here is a possible rewrite of the code:

```javascript
const deepEqual = require('deep-equal');

const objectsToCompare = [
    [{ a: [2, 3], b: [4] }, { a: [2, 3], b: [4] }],
    [{ x: 5, y: [6] }, { x: 5, y: 6 }]
];

const comparisonResults = objectsToCompare.map(([obj1, obj2]) => deepEqual(obj1, obj2));

console.dir(comparisonResults);
```

The Node.js package `node-supports-preserve-symlinks-flag` serves to determine whether the current version of Node.js supports the `--preserve-symlinks` flag. This functionality is useful because this flag was introduced in Node.js version 6.2.0, which influences how symbolic links in the `node_modules` directory are handled.

The module exports a boolean or null value based on the Node.js environment:
- `null`: When the module is executed in a non-Node.js environment, such as a browser.
- `false`: When the Node.js version is older than version 6.2.0, which does not support the `--preserve-symlinks` flag.
- `true`: When the Node.js version is 6.2.0 or newer, which does support the `--preserve-symlinks` flag.

The usage example in the README demonstrates how the exported value from the module can be checked against expected values using assertions.

Below is the implementation of the described functionality:

```javascript
// index.js
'use strict';

var semver = require('semver');

var supportsPreserveSymlinksFlag = (function () {
    // Check if the code is running in a browser
    if (typeof process === 'undefined' || !process || typeof process.version !== 'string') {
        return null;
    }
    
    // The `--preserve-symlinks` flag was introduced in Node.js v6.2.0
    var nodeVersion = process.version;
    return semver.gte(nodeVersion, '6.2.0');
})();

module.exports = supportsPreserveSymlinksFlag;

// test.js
var assert = require('assert');
var supportsPreserveSymlinksFlag = require('./index');

// Here, you should adjust these assertions based on your Node.js version during testing
assert.strictEqual(supportsPreserveSymlinksFlag, process.version && semver.gte(process.version, '6.2.0'));

// package.json
{
    "name": "node-supports-preserve-symlinks-flag",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "node test.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "semver": "^7.3.5"
    }
}
```

This package checks the running environment, uses the `semver` package to compare version numbers, and exports a boolean or null based on the current Node.js runtime's capabilities. Tests require running a Node.js environment where you should manually replace the assertions based on the version you expect to be testing against.
